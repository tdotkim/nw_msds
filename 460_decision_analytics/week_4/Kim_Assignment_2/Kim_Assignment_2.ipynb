    "**i)** The optimal value would be the same. The allowable increase is up to a profit of $320. Since 310 is less than 320 the solution will stay the same  \n",
    "\n",
    "**ii)** 350 is the shadow price but Carco should not be willing to pay that much. The SARHSUp column for C5, our Machine 1 Constraint, shows that the shadow price is only true up to 98.4 THe actual value added to the objective function could be less than 350 and in the worst case, less than $50 which would effectively worsen the objective value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iii)** For Constraint 3, our steel constraint, we see that the shadow price is 0 and the SARHSUp column is to infinity. So no matter how much steel we get, we don't get any added value. Thus Carco should not pay any additional money for steel. \n",
    "\n",
    "**iv)** If Carco were required to produce at least 86 cars Carco's profit would be $32,540.00 + (-20 * (88-86)) = $32,500.00. We know this from Constraint 1 being Cars >= 88, the shadow price being -20, and the lower bound for this being 85. Since 86 is within the lower bound, we can assume for decrease in cars that the shadow price will stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**v)** Carco should not produce any jeeps. By re-running the model with the jeep included, we see the objective value does not change and the amount of cars + trucks created stay the same. We can also look to the problem itself. We know that we need 88 cars and 26 trucks. If removed the 1.6 trucks made, that leaves us 1.6 days on machine 1, and 1.12 days on machine 2 free both of which are less than the 2 needed to make even 1 jeep. "
