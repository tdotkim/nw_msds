### Instructions

R markdown is a plain-text file format for integrating text and R code, and creating transparent, reproducible and interactive reports. An R markdown file (.Rmd) contains metadata, markdown and R code "chunks", and can be "knit" into numerous output types. Answer the test questions by adding R code to the fenced code areas below each item. There are questions that require a written answer that also need to be answered. Enter your comments in the space provided as shown below:

***Answer: (Enter your answer here.)***

Once completed, you will "knit" and submit the resulting .html document and the .Rmd file. The .html will present the output of your R code and your written answers, but your R code will not appear. Your R code will appear in the .Rmd file. The resulting .html document will be graded and a feedback report returned with comments. Points assigned to each item appear in the template.

**Before proceeding, look to the top of the .Rmd for the (YAML) metadata block, where the *title*, *author* and *output* are given. Please change *author* to include your name, with the format 'lastName, firstName.'**

If you encounter issues with knitting the .html, please send an email via Canvas to your TA.

Each code chunk is delineated by six (6) backticks; three (3) at the start and three (3) at the end. After the opening ticks, arguments are passed to the code chunk and in curly brackets. **Please do not add or remove backticks, or modify the arguments or values inside the curly brackets**. An example code chunk is included here:

```{r exampleCodeChunk, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Comments are included in each code chunk, simply as prompts

#...R code placed here

#...R code placed here

```

R code only needs to be added inside the code chunks for each assignment item. However, there are questions that follow many assignment items. Enter your answers in the space provided. An example showing how to use the template and respond to a question follows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example Problem with Solution:**

Use *rbinom()* to generate two random samples of size 10,000 from the binomial distribution. For the first sample, use p = 0.45 and n = 10. For the second sample, use p = 0.55 and n = 10. Convert the sample frequencies to sample proportions and compute the mean number of successes for each sample. Present these statistics.

```{r Example, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

set.seed(123)
sample.one <- table(rbinom(10000, 10, 0.45)) / 10000
sample.two <- table(rbinom(10000, 10, 0.55)) / 10000

successes <- seq(0, 10)

round(sum(sample.one*successes), digits = 1) # [1] 4.5
round(sum(sample.two*successes), digits = 1) # [1] 5.5
```

**Question: How do the simulated expectations compare to calculated binomial expectations?**

***Answer: The calculated binomial expectations are 10(0.45) = 4.5 and 10(0.55) = 5.5. After rounding the simulated results, the same values are obtained.***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submit both the .Rmd and .html files for grading. You may remove the instructions and example problem above, but do not remove the YAML metadata block or the first, "setup" code chunk. Address the steps that appear below and answer all the questions. Be sure to address each question with code and comments as needed. You may use either base R functions or ggplot2 for the visualizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Data Analysis #2

```{r analysis_setup1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Perform the following steps to start the assignment.
 
# 1) Load/attach the following packages via library():  flux, ggplot2, gridExtra, moments, rockchalk, car.
# NOTE:  packages must be installed via install.packages() before they can be loaded.

library(dplyr)
library(flux)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(knitr)
library(rockchalk)
library(tidyverse)

# 2) Use the "mydata.csv" file from Assignment #1 or use the file posted on the course site.  Reading
# the files into R will require sep = "" or sep = " " to format data properly.  Use str() to check file
# structure.

mydata <- read.csv("mydata.csv", sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
# mydata <- read.csv(file.path("c:...", "mydata.csv"), sep = ",")
# mydata <- read.csv(file.path("c:/Rabalone/", "mydata.csv"), sep = ",")

str(mydata)

```

### Test Items starts from here - There are 10 sections - total of 75 points

***\#### Section 1: (5 points) \####***

(1)(a) Form a histogram and QQ plot using RATIO. Calculate skewness and kurtosis using 'rockchalk.' Be aware that with 'rockchalk', the kurtosis value has 3.0 subtracted from it which differs from the 'moments' package.

```{r Part_1a, fig.width = 12}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

hist(x = mydata$RATIO, main = "Abalone Ratio Freqs")

qqnorm(mydata$RATIO)
qqline(mydata$RATIO)


rockchalk::skewness(mydata$RATIO)
rockchalk::kurtosis(mydata$RATIO)


```

(1)(b) Tranform RATIO using *log10()* to create L_RATIO (Kabacoff Section 8.5.2, p. 199-200). Form a histogram and QQ plot using L_RATIO. Calculate the skewness and kurtosis. Create a boxplot of L_RATIO differentiated by CLASS.

```{r Part_1b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}

mydata$L_RATIO <- log10(mydata$RATIO)

r1b_layout <- matrix(c(1,2,3,3),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
layout(r1b_layout)

hist(x = mydata$L_RATIO, main = "Abalone L_Ratio Freqs")

qqnorm(mydata$L_RATIO)
qqline(mydata$L_RATIO)

boxplot(mydata$L_RATIO ~ mydata$CLASS)


rockchalk::skewness(mydata$L_RATIO)
rockchalk::kurtosis(mydata$L_RATIO)

```

(1)(c) Test the homogeneity of variance across classes using *bartlett.test()* (Kabacoff Section 9.2.2, p. 222).

```{r Part_1c}

bartlett.test(mydata$L_RATIO ~ mydata$CLASS)

# p = .5267

```

**Essay Question: Based on steps 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, which variable RATIO or L_RATIO exhibits better conformance to a normal distribution with homogeneous variances across age classes? Why?**

***Answer: (Enter your answer here.)***

***\#### Section 2 (10 points) \####***

(2)(a) Perform an analysis of variance with *aov()* on L_RATIO using CLASS and SEX as the independent variables (Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 212-229). Assume equal variances. Perform two analyses. First, fit a model with the interaction term CLASS:SEX. Then, fit a model without CLASS:SEX. Use *summary()* to obtain the analysis of variance tables (Kabacoff chapter 9, p. 227).

```{r Part_2a}

model_1 <- aov(mydata$L_RATIO ~ mydata$CLASS * mydata$SEX)
summary(model_1)

model_2 <- aov(L_RATIO ~ CLASS + SEX, data = mydata)
summary(model_2)

```

**Essay Question: Compare the two analyses. What does the non-significant interaction term suggest about the relationship between L_RATIO and the factors CLASS and SEX?**

***Answer: Since both analyses returned significant p-values for CLASS and SEX independently, we can reasonably argue that CLASS is a significant variable and SEX is a significant variable. The insignificant p-value for the CLASS*** **SEX interaction shows us that they do not have a combined effect on L_RATIO**\*

(2)(b) For the model without CLASS:SEX (i.e. an interaction term), obtain multiple comparisons with the *TukeyHSD()* function. Interpret the results at the 95% confidence level (*TukeyHSD()* will adjust for unequal sample sizes).

```{r Part_2b}

TukeyHSD(model_2, conf.level=0.95)

```

**Additional Essay Question: first, interpret the trend in coefficients across age classes. What is this indicating about L_RATIO? Second, do these results suggest male and female abalones can be combined into a single category labeled as 'adults?' If not, why not?**

***Answer: In CLASS, there is one standout pair, A2-A1, with a p-value greater than 0.05. This means the pair-wise relationship is not significant for A2-A1 and could be treated as the same thing. Looking at SEX we can see that M-F is the only one with a p-value greater than 0.05 and we can assume the same here as in CLASS where M or F can be treated as the same thing.***

***\#### Section 3: (10 points) \####***

(3)(a1) Here, we will combine "M" and "F" into a new level, "ADULT". The code for doing this is given to you. For (3)(a1), all you need to do is execute the code as given.

```{r Part_3a1}
# Here, we show how to define the new variable TYPE using only base R functions:

mydata$TYPE <- factor(ifelse(mydata$SEX == "I", "I", "ADULT"))
table(mydata$TYPE)


```

(3)(a2) Present side-by-side histograms of VOLUME. One should display infant volumes and, the other, adult volumes.

```{r Part_3a2, fig.width = 12}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

hist(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE=="I"], main="Infant Volume Freq", xlab="Infant Volume", xlim=c(0,1000), ylim=c(0,150), col="lightblue")

hist(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE=="ADULT"], main="Adult Volume Freq", xlab="Adult Volume", xlim=c(0,1000), ylim=c(0,150), col="purple")

```

**Essay Question: Compare the histograms. How do the distributions differ? Are there going to be any difficulties separating infants from adults based on VOLUME?**

***Answer: The infant distribution is heavily right skewed while adults are slightly right skewed but ultimately looks like a normal distribution. I think there is going to be some difficulty in separating adults from infants by volume. There is a great overlap below 300 and some outliers in infants that are as heavy as the heaviest adult.***

(3)(b) Create a scatterplot of SHUCK versus VOLUME and a scatterplot of their base ten logarithms, labeling the variables as L_SHUCK and L_VOLUME. Please be aware the variables, L_SHUCK and L_VOLUME, present the data as orders of magnitude (i.e. VOLUME = 100 = 10\^2 becomes L_VOLUME = 2). Use color to differentiate CLASS in the plots. Repeat using color to differentiate by TYPE.

```{r Part_3b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
L_SHUCK <- log10(mydata$SHUCK)
L_VOLUME <- log10(mydata$VOLUME)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

mydata <- cbind(mydata,L_SHUCK,L_VOLUME)

plot(mydata$VOLUME, mydata$SHUCK, main="CLASS - SHUCK by VOLUME", col=mydata$CLASS, xlab="VOLUME", ylab="SHUCK")
legend(0,160,sort(unique(mydata$CLASS)),col=1:length(mydata$CLASS), pch=1, title="CLASS")

plot(mydata$L_VOLUME, mydata$L_SHUCK, main="CLASS - L_SHUCK by L_VOLUME", col=mydata$CLASS, xlab="L_VOLUME", ylab="L_SHUCK")
legend(0.5,2.25,sort(unique(mydata$CLASS)),col=1:length(mydata$CLASS), pch=1, title="CLASS")

plot(mydata$VOLUME, mydata$SHUCK, main="TYPE - SHUCK by VOLUME", col=mydata$TYPE, xlab="VOLUME", ylab="SHUCK")
legend(0,160,unique(mydata$TYPE),col=1:length(mydata$TYPE), pch=1, title="TYPE")

plot(mydata$L_VOLUME, mydata$L_SHUCK, main="TYPE - L_SHUCK by L_VOLUME", col=mydata$TYPE, xlab="L_VOLUME", ylab="L_SHUCK")
legend(0.5,2.25,unique(mydata$TYPE),col=1:length(mydata$TYPE), pch=1, title="TYPE")

```

**Additional Essay Question: Compare the two scatterplots. What effect(s) does log-transformation appear to have on the variability present in the plot? What are the implications for linear regression analysis? Where do the various CLASS levels appear in the plots? Where do the levels of TYPE appear in the plots?**

***Answer: For both the TYPE and CLASS scatterplots, the log-transformation seems to have reduced the variance. Instead of a wide spread centered at the left/mid area the the points consolidated to the right in nearly straight data. The implication for a linear regression analysis is a better fit since the transformation made this almost perfectly linear. For CLASS things appear in order from left to right, A1 through A-5. So higher shuck/higher volume for A5 and lower shuck/lower volume for A1. For TYPE, Infants have lower shuck/lower volume vs adults.***

***\#### Section 4: (5 points) \####***

(4)(a1) Since abalone growth slows after class A3, infants in classes A4 and A5 are considered mature and candidates for harvest. You are given code in (4)(a1) to reclassify the infants in classes A4 and A5 as ADULTS.

```{r Part_4a1}

mydata$TYPE[mydata$CLASS == "A4" | mydata$CLASS == "A5"] <- "ADULT"
table(mydata$TYPE)

```

(4)(a2) Regress L_SHUCK as the dependent variable on L_VOLUME, CLASS and TYPE (Kabacoff Section 8.2.4, p. 178-186, the Data Analysis Video #2 and Black Section 14.2). Use the multiple regression model: L_SHUCK \~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE. Apply *summary()* to the model object to produce results.

```{r Part_4a2}

r4_model <- lm(L_SHUCK ~ L_VOLUME + CLASS + TYPE, data=mydata)
summary(r4_model)

```

**Essay Question: Interpret the trend in CLASS level coefficient estimates? (Hint: this question is not asking if the estimates are statistically significant. It is asking for an interpretation of the pattern in these coefficients, and how this pattern relates to the earlier displays).**

***Answer: The trend seems to be increasing from A2 to A5 which means variability increases as class increases. We can see this visually in the SHUCK x VOLUME chart for the non-log transformed data where A1 grouping is tight but A5 grouping is spread.***

**Additional Essay Question: Is TYPE an important predictor in this regression? (Hint: This question is not asking if TYPE is statistically significant, but rather how it compares to the other independent variables in terms of its contribution to predictions of L_SHUCK for harvesting decisions.) Explain your conclusion.**

***Answer: TYPE looks to be a pretty important predictor on almost the same level as CLASS. But one thing to keep in mind here is the purpose of all this analysis, which is to help determine the age breakdown of a population to see if they're ready for harvesting. I'm not sure just having a binary infant or adult would be that useful since harvesting a high adult population that might in prime reproductive age might not be a good thing.***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next two analysis steps involve an analysis of the residuals resulting from the regression model in (4)(a) (Kabacoff Section 8.2.4, p. 178-186, the Data Analysis Video #2).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***\#### Section 5: (5 points) \####***

(5)(a) If "model" is the regression object, use model\$residuals and construct a histogram and QQ plot. Compute the skewness and kurtosis. Be aware that with 'rockchalk,' the kurtosis value has 3.0 subtracted from it which differs from the 'moments' package.

```{r Part_5am, fig.width = 12}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

hist(r4_model$residuals, main="Residuals Freq", xlab="Residuals")

qqnorm(r4_model$residuals, main="Residuals QQ Plot")
qqline(r4_model$residuals)

skewness(r4_model$residuals)
kurtosis(r4_model$residuals)

```

(5)(b) Plot the residuals versus L_VOLUME, coloring the data points by CLASS and, a second time, coloring the data points by TYPE. Keep in mind the y-axis and x-axis may be disproportionate which will amplify the variability in the residuals. Present boxplots of the residuals differentiated by CLASS and TYPE (These four plots can be conveniently presented on one page using *par(mfrow..)* or *grid.arrange()*. Test the homogeneity of variance of the residuals across classes using *bartlett.test()* (Kabacoff Section 9.3.2, p. 222).

```{r Part_5b, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
#r5_layout <- layout(matrix(c(1,2,0,0,3,4), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE), heights=c(4, 1))
#r5_layout

plot(mydata$L_VOLUME, r4_model$residuals, main="Residuals - L_VOLUME", col=mydata$CLASS, xlab="L_VOLUME", ylab="Residuals")
legend(x=0.55,-0.01,sort(unique(mydata$CLASS)),col=1:length(mydata$CLASS), pch=1, title="CLASS")

plot(mydata$L_VOLUME, r4_model$residuals, main="Residuals - L_VOLUME", col=mydata$TYPE, xlab="L_VOLUME", ylab="Residuals")
legend(x=0.55,-0.15,sort(unique(mydata$TYPE)),col=1:length(mydata$TYPE), pch=1, title="TYPE")

boxplot(r4_model$residuals ~ mydata$CLASS, main="CLASS Residuals", ylab="Residuals")

boxplot(r4_model$residuals ~ mydata$TYPE, main="TYPE Residuals", ylab="Residuals")


bartlett.test(r4_model$residuals ~ mydata$CLASS)


```

**Essay Question: What is revealed by the displays and calculations in (5)(a) and (5)(b)? Does the model 'fit'? Does this analysis indicate that L_VOLUME, and ultimately VOLUME, might be useful for harvesting decisions? Discuss.**

***In 5a we can see that the distribution looks normal and skewness is near 0 at -0.059. 5b shows that again with the vertical distribution being almost even and if we drew a line it'd be nearly straight at y=0. I think volume might be useful if we do as the next part suggests to determine the likelihood of harvesting infants and at what point the cutoff would result in a minimum sustainable population of infants left to regrow.***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Harvest Strategy:

There is a tradeoff faced in managing abalone harvest. The infant population must be protected since it represents future harvests. On the other hand, the harvest should be designed to be efficient with a yield to justify the effort. This assignment will use VOLUME to form binary decision rules to guide harvesting. If VOLUME is below a "cutoff" (i.e. a specified volume), that individual will not be harvested. If above, it will be harvested. Different rules are possible.The Management needs to make a decision to implement 1 rule that meets the business goal.

The next steps in the assignment will require consideration of the proportions of infants and adults harvested at different cutoffs. For this, similar "for-loops" will be used to compute the harvest proportions. These loops must use the same values for the constants min.v and delta and use the same statement "for(k in 1:10000)." Otherwise, the resulting infant and adult proportions cannot be directly compared and plotted as requested. Note the example code supplied below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***\#### Section 6: (5 points) \####***

(6)(a) A series of volumes covering the range from minimum to maximum abalone volume will be used in a "for loop" to determine how the harvest proportions change as the "cutoff" changes. Code for doing this is provided.

```{r Part_6a}

idxi <- mydata$TYPE == "I"
idxa <- mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"

max.v <- max(mydata$VOLUME)
min.v <- min(mydata$VOLUME)
delta <- (max.v - min.v)/10000
prop.infants <- numeric(10000)
prop.adults <- numeric(10000)
volume.value <- numeric(10000)

total.infants <- sum(idxi)  
total.adults <- sum(idxa)

for (k in 1:10000) { 
	value <- min.v + k*delta
	volume.value[k] <- value
	prop.infants[k] <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[idxi] <= value)/total.infants
	prop.adults[k] <-  sum(mydata$VOLUME[idxa] <= value)/total.adults
}

```

(6)(b) Our first "rule" will be protection of all infants. We want to find a volume cutoff that protects all infants, but gives us the largest possible harvest of adults. We can achieve this by using the volume of the largest infant as our cutoff. You are given code below to identify the largest infant VOLUME and to return the proportion of adults harvested by using this cutoff. You will need to modify this latter code to return the proportion of infants harvested using this cutoff. Remember that we will harvest any individual with VOLUME greater than our cutoff.

```{r Part_6b}
# Largest infant volume
(max_inf_vol <- max(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"]))  # [1] 526.6383

# Proportion of adults harvested
r6_aduhar <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > max_inf_vol) /
  total.adults  # [1] 0.2476573

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested
r6_infhar <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > max_inf_vol) /
  total.infants
r6_infhar

r6_aduhar
# If we use the largest infant volume, we harvest approximately 24.8% of adults and 0%,
# as expected, of infants.

```

(6)(c) Our next approaches will look at what happens when we use the median infant and adult harvest VOLUMEs. Using the median VOLUMEs as our cutoffs will give us (roughly) 50% harvests. We need to identify the median volumes and calculate the resulting infant and adult harvest proportions for both.

```{r Part_6c}
# Add code to determine the median infant volume:

r6_median_infantv <- median(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"])
r6_median_infantv

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested

median_infhar <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > r6_median_infantv) /
  total.infants
median_infhar

# Add code to calculate the proportion of adults harvested
median_aduhar <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > r6_median_infantv) /
  total.adults
median_aduhar

# If we use the median infant volume as our cutoff, we harvest almost 50% of our infants
# and a little more than 93% of our adults.


# Add code to determine the median adult volume:
r6_median_adultv <- median(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"])
r6_median_adultv

# Add code to calculate the proportion of infants harvested
adu_median_infhar <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "I"] > r6_median_adultv) /
  total.infants
adu_median_infhar

# Add code to calculate the proportion of adults harvested
adu_median_aduhar <- sum(mydata$VOLUME[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT"] > r6_median_adultv) / total.adults
adu_median_aduhar

# If we use the median adult volume as our cutoff, we harvest almost 50% of adults
# and approximately 2.4% of infants.

```

(6)(d) Next, we will create a plot showing the infant conserved proportions (i.e. "not harvested," the prop.infants vector) and the adult conserved proportions (i.e. prop.adults) as functions of volume.value. We will add vertical A-B lines and text annotations for the three (3) "rules" considered, thus far: "protect all infants," "median infant" and "median adult." Your plot will have two (2) curves - one (1) representing infant and one (1) representing adult proportions as functions of volume.value - and three (3) A-B lines representing the cutoffs determined in (6)(b) and (6)(c).

```{r Part_6d, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
colors <- c("Infants" = "darkblue", "Adults" = "darkred")

ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.infants,color='Infants'),size=1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.adults,color='Adults'),size=1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_infantv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_adultv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype=2, size=1) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median Infant = \n",round(r6_median_infantv, 2)), x=r6_median_infantv+75, y=.05) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median Adult = \n",round(r6_median_adultv, 2)), x=r6_median_adultv+75, y=.05) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Max Infant = \n",round(max_inf_vol, 2)), x=max_inf_vol+75, y=.05) +
  labs(title = 'Proportion of Adult and Infants Harvested',
       color = "Legend") +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

**Essay Question: The two 50% "median" values serve a descriptive purpose illustrating the difference between the populations. What do these values suggest regarding possible cutoffs for harvesting?**

***Answer: The median infant is the way to go based on this visualization and the actual percentage of infants harvested. With only 2.4% of infants being harvested using the median infant volume, it seems like a tolerable loss for harvesting 50% of adults. The median adult volume would capture way too many infants at 93.3%***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

More harvest strategies:

This part will address the determination of a cutoff volume.value corresponding to the observed maximum difference in harvest percentages of adults and infants. In other words, we want to find the volume value such that the vertical distance between the infant curve and the adult curve is maximum. To calculate this result, the vectors of proportions from item (6) must be used. These proportions must be converted from "not harvested" to "harvested" proportions by using (1 - prop.infants) for infants, and (1 - prop.adults) for adults. The reason the proportion for infants drops sooner than adults is that infants are maturing and becoming adults with larger volumes.

Note on ROC:

There are multiple packages that have been developed to create ROC curves. However, these packages - and the functions they define - expect to see predicted and observed classification vectors. Then, from those predictions, those functions calculate the true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) and other classification performance metrics. Worthwhile and you will certainly encounter them if you work in R on classification problems. However, in this case, we already have vectors with the TPRs and FPRs. Our adult harvest proportion vector, (1 - prop.adults), is our TPR. This is the proportion, at each possible 'rule,' at each hypothetical harvest threshold (i.e. element of volume.value), of individuals we will correctly identify as adults and harvest. Our FPR is the infant harvest proportion vector, (1 - prop.infants). We can think of TPR as the Confidence level (ie 1 - Probability of Type I error and FPR as the Probability of Type II error. At each possible harvest threshold, what is the proportion of infants we will mistakenly harvest? Our ROC curve, then, is created by plotting (1 - prop.adults) as a function of (1 - prop.infants). In short, how much more 'right' we can be (moving upward on the y-axis), if we're willing to be increasingly wrong; i.e. harvest some proportion of infants (moving right on the x-axis)?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***\#### Section 7: (10 points) \####***

(7)(a) Evaluate a plot of the difference ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)) versus volume.value. Compare to the 50% "split" points determined in (6)(a). There is considerable variability present in the peak area of this plot. The observed "peak" difference may not be the best representation of the data. One solution is to smooth the data to determine a more representative estimate of the maximum difference.

```{r Part_7a}

diff_7 <- (1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)

r7_df <- data.frame(volume.value,diff_7)
names(r7_df) <- c('volume','diff')
r7_df

ggplot(data = r7_df,aes(x=volume,y=diff) ) +
  geom_line(linetype=1,color='black') +
  geom_smooth(linetype=2,color='darkred') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_infantv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_adultv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median Infant = \n",round(r6_median_infantv, 2)), x=r6_median_infantv+100, y=.05) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median Adult = \n",round(r6_median_adultv, 2)), x=r6_median_adultv+100, y=.05)

```

(7)(b) Since curve smoothing is not studied in this course, code is supplied below. Execute the following code to create a smoothed curve to append to the plot in (a). The procedure is to individually smooth (1-prop.adults) and (1-prop.infants) before determining an estimate of the maximum difference.

```{r Part_7b}

y.loess.a <- loess(1 - prop.adults ~ volume.value, span = 0.25,
	family = c("symmetric"))
y.loess.i <- loess(1 - prop.infants ~ volume.value, span = 0.25,
	family = c("symmetric"))
smooth.difference <- predict(y.loess.a) - predict(y.loess.i)

```

(7)(c) Present a plot of the difference ((1 - prop.adults) - (1 - prop.infants)) versus volume.value with the variable smooth.difference superimposed. Determine the volume.value corresponding to the maximum smoothed difference (Hint: use *which.max()*). Show the estimated peak location corresponding to the cutoff determined.

Include, side-by-side, the plot from (6)(d) but with a fourth vertical A-B line added. That line should intercept the x-axis at the "max difference" volume determined from the smoothed curve here.

```{r Part_7c, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
smooth_max <- volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]

r7_plot1 <- ggplot(data = r7_df,aes(x=volume,y=diff) ) +
  geom_line(linetype=1,color='black') +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value,smooth.difference),linetype=2,color='darkred') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = smooth_max) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median Smoothed = \n",round(smooth_max, 3)), x=smooth_max+100, y=.05) +
  labs(title = 'Difference in Proportions Harvested') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 

r7_plot2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.infants,color='Infants'),size=1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.adults,color='Adults'),size=1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_infantv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_adultv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype=2, size=1) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median \nInfant = \n",round(r6_median_infantv, 2)), x=r6_median_infantv+75, y=.05,size = 4) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median \nAdult = \n",round(r6_median_adultv, 2)), x=r6_median_adultv+75, y=.05,size = 4) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Max \nInfant = \n",round(max_inf_vol, 2)), x=max_inf_vol+75, y=.45, size = 4) +
  labs(title = 'Proportion of Adult and Infants Harvested',
       color = "Legend",
       legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = smooth_max) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median \nSmooth = \n",round(smooth_max, 3)), x=smooth_max+90, y=.62,size = 4)

grid.arrange(r7_plot1, r7_plot2, nrow=1)
```

(7)(d) What separate harvest proportions for infants and adults would result if this cutoff is used? Show the separate harvest proportions. We will actually calculate these proportions in two ways: first, by 'indexing' and returning the appropriate element of the (1 - prop.adults) and (1 - prop.infants) vectors, and second, by simply counting the number of adults and infants with VOLUME greater than the vlume threshold of interest.

Code for calculating the adult harvest proportion using both approaches is provided.

```{r Part_7d}

(1 - prop.adults)[which.max(smooth.difference)]  # [1] 0.7416332
# OR,
maxdiffadu <- sum(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT", "VOLUME"] >
      volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]) / total.adults # [1] 0.7416332

maxdiffinf <- sum(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"] >
      volume.value[which.max(smooth.difference)]) / total.infants

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are alternative ways to determine cutoffs. Two such cutoffs are described below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***\#### Section 8: (10 points) \####***

(8)(a) Harvesting of infants in CLASS "A1" must be minimized. The smallest volume.value cutoff that produces a zero harvest of infants from CLASS "A1" may be used as a baseline for comparison with larger cutoffs. Any smaller cutoff would result in harvesting infants from CLASS "A1."

Compute this cutoff, and the proportions of infants and adults with VOLUME exceeding this cutoff. Code for determining this cutoff is provided. Show these proportions. You may use either the 'indexing' or 'count' approach, or both.

```{r Part_8a}

r8_cut <- volume.value[volume.value > max(mydata[mydata$CLASS == "A1" &
  mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"])][1] # [1] 206.786
r8_cut

r8_no_A1_infants <- sum(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "I", "VOLUME"] > r8_cut) / total.infants
r8_no_A1_infants

r8_adults <- sum(mydata[mydata$TYPE == "ADULT", "VOLUME"] > r8_cut) / total.adults
r8_adults
```

(8)(b) Next, append one (1) more vertical A-B line to our (6)(d) graph. This time, showing the "zero A1 infants" cutoff from (8)(a). This graph should now have five (5) A-B lines: "protect all infants," "median infant," "median adult," "max difference" and "zero A1 infants."

```{r Part_8b, fig.width = 12}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.infants,color='Infants'),size=1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(volume.value, prop.adults,color='Adults'),size=1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = max_inf_vol, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_infantv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r6_median_adultv, linetype=1, size=1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype=2, size=1) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median \nInfant \n",round(r6_median_infantv, 2)), x=r6_median_infantv+35, y=.45,size = 4) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median \nAdult \n",round(r6_median_adultv, 2)), x=r6_median_adultv+45, y=.45,size = 4) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Protect All \nInfants \n",round(max_inf_vol, 2)), x=max_inf_vol+45, y=.94, size = 4) +
  labs(title = 'Proportion of Adult and Infants Harvested',
       color = "Legend",
       legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = smooth_max) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Max Diff \n",round(smooth_max, 3)), x=smooth_max+35, y=.57,size = 4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = r8_cut) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("No A1 \nInfants \n",round(r8_cut, 3)), x=r8_cut+26, y=.62,size = 4)


```

***\#### Section 9: (5 points) \####***

(9)(a) Construct an ROC curve by plotting (1 - prop.adults) versus (1 - prop.infants). Each point which appears corresponds to a particular volume.value. Show the location of the cutoffs determined in (6), (7) and (8) on this plot and label each.

```{r Part_9, fig.width = 8.5}
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(1-prop.infants, 1-prop.adults),color='darkblue',size=2) +
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, linetype=2) +
  geom_point(aes(x=r6_infhar, y=r6_aduhar), size=8, shape=1, color='black', stroke=3) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Protect All\nInfants Vol\n",round(max_inf_vol, 2)), x=r6_infhar+.12, y=r6_aduhar) +
  geom_point(aes(x=adu_median_infhar, y=adu_median_aduhar), size=8, shape=1, color='black', stroke=3) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median Adult\nVol\n",round(r6_median_adultv, 2)), x=adu_median_infhar+.12, y=adu_median_aduhar) +
  geom_point(aes(x=maxdiffinf, y=maxdiffadu), size=8, shape=1, color='black', stroke=3) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Max Diff\nVol\n",round(smooth_max, 2)), x=maxdiffinf+.04, y=maxdiffadu-.10) +
  geom_point(aes(x=r8_no_A1_infants, y=r8_adults), size=8, shape=1, color='black', stroke=3) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Zero A1\nInfants Vol\n",round(r8_cut, 2)), x=r8_no_A1_infants+.04, y=r8_adults-.15) +
  geom_point(aes(x=median_infhar, y=median_aduhar), size=8, shape=1, color='black', stroke=3) +
  annotate("text", label=paste("Median \nInfants Vol\n",round(r6_median_infantv, 2)), x=median_infhar+.04, y=median_aduhar-.15)


```

(9)(b) Numerically integrate the area under the ROC curve and report your result. This is most easily done with the *auc()* function from the "flux" package. Areas-under-curve, or AUCs, greater than 0.8 are taken to indicate good discrimination potential.

```{r Part_9b}

auc(1-prop.infants, 1-prop.adults)

```

***\#### Section 10: (10 points) \####***

(10)(a) Prepare a table showing each cutoff along with the following: 1) true positive rate (1-prop.adults, 2) false positive rate (1-prop.infants), 3) harvest proportion of the total population

To calculate the total harvest proportions, you can use the 'count' approach, but ignoring TYPE; simply count the number of individuals (i.e. rows) with VOLUME greater than a given threshold and divide by the total number of individuals in our dataset.

```{r Part_10}
library(dplyr)

protectTH <- (r6_infhar*total.infants + r6_aduhar*total.adults)/(total.infants+total.adults)

medianinfTH <- (median_infhar*total.infants + median_aduhar*total.adults)/(total.infants+total.adults)

medianaduTH <- (adu_median_infhar*total.infants + adu_median_aduhar*total.adults)/(total.infants+total.adults)

maxdiffTH <- (maxdiffinf*total.infants + maxdiffadu*total.adults)/(total.infants+total.adults)

zeroa1TH <- (r8_no_A1_infants*total.infants + r8_adults*total.adults)/(total.infants+total.adults)

r10_df <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 5, nrow = 0))
colnames(r10_df) <- c('Cutoff', 'Volume', 'TPR', 'FPR', 'totalHarvest')

holder1 = list(Cutoff= 'Protect all Infants', Volume = round(max_inf_vol,1), TPR = r6_aduhar, FPR = r6_infhar, totalHarvest = protectTH)

holder2 = list(Cutoff= 'Median Infants', Volume = round(r6_median_infantv,1), TPR = median_aduhar, FPR = median_infhar, totalHarvest = medianinfTH)

holder3 = list(Cutoff= 'Median Adults', Volume = round(r6_median_adultv,1), TPR = adu_median_aduhar, FPR = adu_median_infhar, totalHarvest = medianaduTH)

holder4 = list(Cutoff= 'Max Difference', Volume = round(smooth_max,1), TPR = maxdiffadu, FPR = maxdiffinf, totalHarvest = maxdiffTH)

holder5 = list(Cutoff= 'Zero A1 Infants', Volume = round(r8_cut,1), TPR = r8_adults, FPR = r8_no_A1_infants, totalHarvest = zeroa1TH)

r10_df = rbind(r10_df,holder1, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
r10_df = rbind(r10_df,holder2, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
r10_df = rbind(r10_df,holder3, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
r10_df = rbind(r10_df,holder4, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
r10_df = rbind(r10_df,holder5, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

r10_df$TPR <- round(r10_df$TPR,3)
r10_df$FPR <- round(r10_df$FPR,3)
r10_df$totalHarvest <- round(r10_df$totalHarvest,3)
r10_df[order(r10_df$FPR, decreasing = TRUE),]
```

**Essay Question: Based on the ROC curve, it is evident a wide range of possible "cutoffs" exist. Compare and discuss the five cutoffs determined in this assignment.**

***Answer: Sorting the new dataframe by FPR we can see the different cutoffs in order of most aggressive to most conservative harvesting strategies. I think FPR and totalHarvest will be critical columns in determining a strategy for moving forward. FPR will determine how many overall infants are harvest which directly impacts repopulation and totalHarvest shows net harvest which directly affects the bottom line.***

**Final Essay Question: Assume you are expected to make a presentation of your analysis to the investigators How would you do so? Consider the following in your answer:**

1.  Would you make a specific recommendation or outline various choices and tradeoffs?
2.  What qualifications or limitations would you present regarding your analysis?
3.  If it is necessary to proceed based on the current analysis, what suggestions would you have for implementation of a cutoff?\
4.  What suggestions would you have for planning future abalone studies of this type?

***Answer: I would present the table from R10 to the team and outline the various cutoffs and what proportion of the each adult/infant pop that could end up being harvested. I'm not a biologist so I wouldn't make a recommendation but present the findings as the starting point for having a true SME make a plan. A slide or two would be dedicated to qualifying this data as a single data set that is not indicative of all abalone but acts as a baseline. If pressed for a hard choice, I'd go with the Median Adult volume solution. The reasoning for this would be that we preserve \~98% of the infant population and that overall harvests would be cut to 36%. Since we've seen what species collapse has done to other industries, we have to enter a protectionist mindset for now while we rebuild and conduct more studies to maximize harvest yields while balancing preservation. I'd point to a pressing need to efficiently and accurately identify harvestable ablone. THis means changing the study focus from what we just did to more practical business studies for quickly sorting abalone to keep/toss. I think the realm of physical characteristics of abalone might be tapped out determining age so really getting as much juice out of what is there already is the way forward.***
