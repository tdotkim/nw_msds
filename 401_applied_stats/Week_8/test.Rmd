## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

list1 = c(2,5,8,10,12)
list2 = c(7,11,13,20,24)

our_model <- lm(list2 ~ list1)
summary(our_model)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

xvals <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
yvals <- c(1.24,5.23,7.24,7.60,9.97,14.31,13.99,14.88,18.04,20.70)

cor.test(x = xvals, y = yvals,
         method = "pearson")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

#z = (p1 - p2) / sqrt(p(1-p)) * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2)
p1 - p2 = 39/100 - 49/100
p = x1 + x2/ n1 + n2
39+49/100+100 = .44
1-p = .56

SE = sqrt [ s21 / n1 + s22 / n2 ]

```
