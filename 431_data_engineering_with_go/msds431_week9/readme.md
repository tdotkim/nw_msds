# Generative AI and Go

## Project Summary

For week 9 we were tasked with exploring the possibilities of using generated code.

We tested three levels of generated code.

1. cweill/gotests. This is a generator that generates boilerplat code for unit testing.

2. Github Copilot. This is a generative AI built on top of ChatGPT 3.5 to assist with writing code.

3. ChatGPT. This is a generative AI and we used the free version CHaptGPT 3.5.

## Findings

### *cweill/gotests*
- - - -
This package has been extremely useful in the previous weeks and in this week as well. Being able to stand up a table based unit test for any function with the structs and test loop already created has been a major speed boost for testing. The only step a user has to take with this package is to create entries in the tatble with tests to run. 

In the go-generate folder is an example from Testing Statistics with a main.go file and main_test.go file that was generated. The main_test_oldversion.go is the handwritten unit tests that took substantially longer without the use of generated tests.

### *GitHub Co-Pilot*
- - - -
I tested this with the chat option inside of vscode using this prompt "tdotkim: I want to write a program that runs a ordinary least squares regression on the Anscombe Quartet, with the anscombe quartet hardcoded in, and writes the slope, intercept, and r-squared value of the regression to the terminal". The result was pretty quick.

The results:

I also decided to have it write unit tests for me.

Overall this was a breeze to have it write everything and it is very accurate. Having the ability to also nudge it is also great to adjust tiny bits of it. The VSCode integration is also working flawlessly. 

### *ChatGPT 3.5*
- - - -
Using the same promtps from GitHub Co-Pilot, we got slightly different outputs.

ChatGPT's initial program returns several errors.

1. floats.SumFunc() is called but this is not a part of the floats module in gonum.
2. data.Mul(&regression, mat.NewVecDense(len(x), nil)) is used as value but &regression means the results are being stored and this shouldn't be used in this manner. It does not return anything but modifies in place. 

In the testing file it runs into the same issue.

I'm unsure what the root cause of the issue is but even with further prompting, ChatGPT's code is still broken and feeding in prompts regarding errors simply leads to new errors. After multiple prompts, it seems like ChatGPT is incapable of resolving the issue. 

## Overall Recommendation

The company should explore using the GitHub stack and GitHub Copilot to maximize synergies. GitHub as the repo + GitHub Actions for CI/CD + GitHub Co-Pilott for assisted programming seems like a great combination. It allows programmers to work faster and like partial self-driving, automates the tedious aspects while allowing for human oversight. 



## Folder Setup


*./go-generate:* \
The original program from Week 2 with the old testing file and the generated testing file from cweill/gotests.

*./github-copilot:* \
Fully generated by copilot for the main.go file and the main_test.go file. Works well. 

*./chatgpt:* \
Fully generated by copilot for the main.go file and the main_test.go file. Does not run and does not compile due to the issues mentioned above.  

*./chatgpt_fixprompt:* \
Attempts from chat-gpt to fix the issue.  

*./scraper:* \
Contains the scraper built on Go-Colly. Main go file references this package locally. 


## Instructions

To recreate this please run the executables in the respective folders except for chat-gpt where you'll need to call the script directly to see the errors.
