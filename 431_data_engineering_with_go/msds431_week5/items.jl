many fields that deal with specific aspects of robotics. For example, within mechanical engineering, the term robotics refers to the construction of the physical structures of a robots, while in computer science, robotics focuses on the study of robotic software.There are also many other aspects of robotic development and releted fields that overleap in its, including  electical, control, software, information, electronic, telecomunication, computer, mechatronic, materials and biomedical engineering. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.The field of robotics develops machines that can automate tasks and do various jobs that a human might not be able to do. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g., in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other tasks mainly performed by a human. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.Certain robots require user input to operate, while other robots function autonomously. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.\u0026#91;2\u0026#93;.mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Etymology[edit]The word robotics was derived from the word robot, which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means work/job. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word robotics was first used in print by Isaac Asimov, in his science fiction short story \"Liar!\", published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics, he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots. In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story Runaround (Astounding Science Fiction, March 1942),\u0026#91;4\u0026#93;\u0026#91;5\u0026#93; where he introduced his concept of The Three Laws of Robotics. However, the original publication of \"Liar!\" predates that of \"Runaround\" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.History[edit]See also: History of robotsIn 1948, Norbert Wiener formulated the principles of cybernetics, the basis of practical robotics.Fully autonomous robots only appeared in the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the Unimate, was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them. Commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately, and more reliably than humans. They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery,\u0026#91;6\u0026#93; weaponry, laboratory research, safety, and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods.\u0026#91;7\u0026#93;DateSignificanceRobot nameInventorThird century B.C. and earlierOne of the earliest descriptions of automata appears in the Lie Zi text, on a much earlier encounter between King Mu of Zhou (1023–957 BC) and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an 'artificer'. The latter allegedly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork.\u0026#91;8\u0026#93;Yan Shi (Chinese\u0026#58; 偃师)First century A.D. and earlierDescriptions of more than 100 machines and automata, including a fire engine, a wind organ, a coin-operated machine, and a steam-powered engine, in Pneumatica and Automata by Heron of AlexandriaCtesibius, Philo of Byzantium, Heron of Alexandria, and othersc. 420 B.CA wooden, steam-propelled bird, which was able to flyFlying pigeonArchytas of Tarentum1206Created early humanoid automata, programmable automaton band\u0026#91;9\u0026#93;Robot band, hand-washing automaton,\u0026#91;10\u0026#93; automated moving peacocks\u0026#91;11\u0026#93;Al-Jazari1495Designs for a humanoid robotMechanical KnightLeonardo da Vinci1560sClockwork Prayer that had machinal feet built under its robes that imitated walking.

As opposed to the human-operated The Turk and Ajeeb, El Ajedrecista had an integrated automaton  built to play chess without human guidance. It only played an endgame with three chess pieces, automatically moving a white king and a rook to checkmate the black king moved by a human opponent.\u0026#91;15\u0026#93;\u0026#91;16\u0026#93;El AjedrecistaLeonardo Torres Quevedo1914In his paper Essays on Automatics published in 1914, Leonardo Torres Quevedo proposed a machine that makes \"judgments\" using sensors that capture information from the outside, parts that manipulate the outside world like arms, power sources such as batteries and air pressure, and most importantly, captured information and past information. It was defined as an organism that can control reactions in response to external information and adapt to changes in the environment to change its behavior.\u0026#91;17\u0026#93;\u0026#91;18\u0026#93;\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;\u0026#91;20\u0026#93;Essays on AutomaticsLeonardo Torres Quevedo1921First fictional automatons called \"robots\" appear in the play R.U.R.Rossum's Universal RobotsKarel Čapek1930sHumanoid robot exhibited at the 1939 and 1940 World's FairsElektroWestinghouse Electric Corporation1946First general-purpose digital computerWhirlwindMultiple people1948Simple robots exhibiting biological behaviors\u0026#91;21\u0026#93;Elsie and ElmerWilliam Grey Walter1956First commercial robot, from the Unimation company founded by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger, based on Devol's patents\u0026#91;22\u0026#93;UnimateGeorge Devol1961First installed industrial robot.UnimateGeorge Devol1967 to 1972First full-scale humanoid intelligent robot,\u0026#91;23\u0026#93;\u0026#91;24\u0026#93; and first android.

Although being very diverse in application and form, they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction:Robots all have some kind of mechanical construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task. For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud might use caterpillar tracks. Origami inspired robots can sense and analyze in extreme environments.\u0026#91;32\u0026#93; The mechanical aspect of the robot is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it. Form follows function.Robots have electrical components that power and control the machinery. For example, the robot with caterpillar tracks would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads. That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic electrical circuit. Even petrol-powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol-powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status), and operation (robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)All robots contain some level of computer programming code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not be able to go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly structured, its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence, and hybrid. A robot with remote control programming has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. A hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions in them.Applications[edit]As more and more robots are designed for specific tasks, this method of classification becomes more relevant. For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications. They are termed \"assembly robots\". For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e. the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc. as an integrated unit. Such an integrated robotic system is called a \"welding robot\" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks. Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as \"heavy-duty robots\".\u0026#91;33\u0026#93;Current and potential applications include:Military robots.Industrial robots. Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing (since the 1960s). According to the Robotic Industries Association US data, in 2016 the automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with 52% of total sales.\u0026#91;34\u0026#93; In the auto industry, they can amount for more than half of the \"labor\". There are even \"lights off\" factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that was fully automated as early as 2003.\u0026#91;35\u0026#93;Cobots (collaborative robots).\u0026#91;36\u0026#93;Construction robots. Construction robots can be separated into three types: traditional robots, robotic arm, and robotic exoskeleton.\u0026#91;37\u0026#93;Agricultural robots (AgRobots).\u0026#91;38\u0026#93; The use of robots in agriculture is closely linked to the concept of AI-assisted precision agriculture and drone usage.\u0026#91;39\u0026#93; 1996-1998 research also proved that robots can perform a herding task.\u0026#91;40\u0026#93;Medical robots of various types (such as da Vinci Surgical System and Hospi).Robot-assisted surgery designed and used in clinics.\u0026#91;41\u0026#93;Kitchen automation.

Robots such as LEGO® Mindstorms are used to teach coding, mathematics, and creative skills.\u0026#91;49\u0026#93;\u0026#91;50\u0026#93;Components[edit]Power source[edit]Further information: Power supply and Energy storageThe InSight lander with solar panels deployed in a cleanroomAt present, mostly (lead–acid) batteries are used as a power source. Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots. They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries which are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime, and weight. Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine, can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel, require heat dissipation, and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage.\u0026#91;51\u0026#93; Potential power sources could be:pneumatic (compressed gases)Solar power (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)hydraulics (liquids)flywheel energy storageorganic garbage (through anaerobic digestion)nuclearActuation[edit]Main article: ActuatorA robotic leg powered by air musclesActuators are the \"muscles\" of a robot, the parts which convert stored energy into movement.\u0026#91;52\u0026#93; By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.Electric motors[edit]Main article: Electric motorThe vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.Linear actuators[edit]Main article: Linear actuatorVarious types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics. They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air (pneumatic actuator) or an oil (hydraulic actuator) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew. Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator such as a rack and pinion on a car.Series elastic actuators[edit]Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control. Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions.\u0026#91;53\u0026#93;  Furthermore, it also provides energy efficiency and shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components. This approach has successfully been employed in various robots, particularly advanced manufacturing robots\u0026#91;54\u0026#93; and walking humanoid robots.\u0026#91;55\u0026#93;\u0026#91;56\u0026#93;The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the passivity framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments.\u0026#91;57\u0026#93; Despite its remarkable stability and robustness, this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade-off performance. The reader is referred to the following survey which summarizes the common controller architectures for SEA along with the corresponding sufficient passivity conditions.\u0026#91;58\u0026#93; One recent study has derived the necessary and sufficient passivity conditions for one of the most common impedance control architectures, namely velocity-sourced SEA.\u0026#91;59\u0026#93; This work is of particular importance as it drives the non-conservative passivity bounds in an SEA scheme for the first time which allows a larger selection of control gains.Air muscles[edit]Main article: Pneumatic artificial musclesPneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles, are special tubes that expand (typically up to 42%) when air is forced inside them. They are used in some robot applications.\u0026#91;60\u0026#93;\u0026#91;61\u0026#93;\u0026#91;62\u0026#93;Wire muscles[edit]Main article: Shape memory alloyMuscle wire, also known as shape memory alloy, Nitinol® or Flexinol® wire, is a material that contracts (under 5%) when electricity is applied. They have been used for some small robot applications.\u0026#91;63\u0026#93;\u0026#91;64\u0026#93;Electroactive polymers[edit]Main article: Electroactive polymersEAPs or EPAMs are a plastic material that can contract substantially (up to 380% activation strain) from electricity, and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots,\u0026#91;65\u0026#93; and to enable new robots to float,\u0026#91;66\u0026#93; fly, swim or walk.\u0026#91;67\u0026#93;Piezo motors[edit]Main article: Piezoelectric motorRecent alternatives to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors. These work on a fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line.\u0026#91;68\u0026#93; Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw. The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size.\u0026#91;69\u0026#93; These motors are already available commercially, and being used on some robots.\u0026#91;70\u0026#93;\u0026#91;71\u0026#93;Elastic nanotubes[edit]Further information: Carbon nanotubeElastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development. The absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent, with energy storage levels of perhaps 10\u0026#160;J/cm3 for metal nanotubes. Human biceps could be replaced with an 8\u0026#160;mm diameter wire of this material. Such compact \"muscle\" might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans.\u0026#91;72\u0026#93;Sensing[edit]Main articles: Robotic sensing and Robotic sensorsSensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment, or internal components. This is essential for robots to perform their tasks, and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response. They are used for various forms of measurements, to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions, and to provide real-time information about the task it is performing.Touch[edit]Main article: Tactile sensorCurrent robotic and prosthetic hands receive far less tactile information than the human hand. Recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips.\u0026#91;73\u0026#93;\u0026#91;74\u0026#93; The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin. Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting the robotic grip on held objects.Scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a prosthetic hand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one—allowing patients to write with it, type on a keyboard, play piano and perform other fine movements. The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feelings in its fingertips.\u0026#91;75\u0026#93;Further information: Sensory-motor mapVision[edit]Main article: Computer visionSee also: Vision processing unitComputer vision is the science and technology of machines that see. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras.In most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.Computer vision systems rely on image sensors that detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible light or infra-red light. The sensors are designed using solid-state physics. The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using optics. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment. Like human eyes, robots' \"eyes\" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities.There is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological system, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have a background in biology.Other[edit]Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar, radar, and sonar.\u0026#91;76\u0026#93; Lidar measures the distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. Radar uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. Sonar uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water.Manipulation[edit]KUKA industrial robot operating in a foundryPuma, one of the first industrial robotsBaxter, a modern and versatile industrial robot developed by Rodney BrooksLefty, first checker playing robotFurther information: Mobile manipulatorA definition of robotic manipulation has been provided by Matt Mason as: \"manipulation refers to an agent's control of its environment through selective contact\".\u0026#91;77\u0026#93;Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, or otherwise have an effect. Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect (whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to as end effectors,\u0026#91;78\u0026#93; while the \"arm\" is referred to as a manipulator.\u0026#91;79\u0026#93; Most robot arms have replaceable end-effectors, each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks. Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general-purpose manipulator, for example, a humanoid hand.\u0026#91;80\u0026#93;Mechanical grippers[edit]One of the most common types of end-effectors are \"grippers\". In its simplest manifestation, it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can, for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire running through it.\u0026#91;81\u0026#93; Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand.\u0026#91;82\u0026#93; Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand.\u0026#91;83\u0026#93;\u0026#91;84\u0026#93; Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.Suction end-effectors[edit]Suction end-effectors, powered by vacuum generators, are very simple astrictive\u0026#91;85\u0026#93; devices that can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction.Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens, often use very simple vacuum end-effectors.Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception.  As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has 1 centimeter of error.  While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle, the soft suction end-effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface.General purpose effectors[edit]Some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands, like the Shadow Hand, MANUS,\u0026#91;86\u0026#93; and the Schunk hand.\u0026#91;87\u0026#93; These are highly dexterous manipulators, with as many as 20 degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors.\u0026#91;88\u0026#93;Locomotion[edit]Main articles: Robot locomotion and Mobile robotRolling robots[edit]Segway in the Robot museum in NagoyaFor simplicity, most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks. Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to.Two-wheeled balancing robots[edit]Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum.\u0026#91;89\u0026#93; Many different balancing robots have been designed.\u0026#91;90\u0026#93; While the Segway is not commonly thought of as a robot, it can be thought of as a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform). An example of this use has been as NASA's Robonaut that has been mounted on a Segway.\u0026#91;91\u0026#93;One-wheeled balancing robots[edit]Main article: Self-balancing unicycleA one-wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two-wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any 2D direction using a round ball as its only wheel. Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such as Carnegie Mellon University's \"Ballbot\" which is the approximate height and width of a person, and Tohoku Gakuin University's \"BallIP\".\u0026#91;92\u0026#93; Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people.\u0026#91;93\u0026#93;Spherical orb robots[edit]Main article: Spherical robotSeveral attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball, either by spinning a weight inside the ball,\u0026#91;94\u0026#93;\u0026#91;95\u0026#93; or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere.\u0026#91;96\u0026#93;\u0026#91;97\u0026#93; These have also been referred to as an orb bot\u0026#91;98\u0026#93; or a ball bot.\u0026#91;99\u0026#93;\u0026#91;100\u0026#93;Six-wheeled robots[edit]Using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass.Tracked robots[edit]TALON military robots used by the United States ArmyTank tracks provide even more traction than a six-wheeled robot. Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels, therefore are very common for outdoor and military robots, where the robot must drive on very rough terrain. However, they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors. Examples include NASA's Urban Robot \"Urbie\".\u0026#91;101\u0026#93;Walking applied to robots[edit]Further information: Mantis the spider robotWalking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve. Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however, none have yet been made which are as robust as a human. There has been much study on human-inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A\u0026amp;M University.\u0026#91;102\u0026#93; Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct.\u0026#91;103\u0026#93;\u0026#91;104\u0026#93; Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs. None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are:ZMP technique[edit]Main article: Zero moment pointThe zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as Honda's ASIMO. The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces (the combination of Earth's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor reaction force (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no moment (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over).\u0026#91;105\u0026#93; However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the lavatory.\u0026#91;106\u0026#93;\u0026#91;107\u0026#93;\u0026#91;108\u0026#93; ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.Hopping[edit]Several robots, built in the 1980s by Marc Raibert at the MIT Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot could stay upright simply by hopping. The movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself.\u0026#91;109\u0026#93; Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs. A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults.\u0026#91;110\u0026#93; A quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot, run, pace, and bound.\u0026#91;111\u0026#93; For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page.\u0026#91;112\u0026#93;Dynamic balancing (controlled falling)[edit]A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability.\u0026#91;113\u0026#93; This technique was recently demonstrated by Anybots' Dexter Robot,\u0026#91;114\u0026#93; which is so stable, it can even jump.\u0026#91;115\u0026#93; Another example is the TU Delft Flame.Passive dynamics[edit]Main article: Passive dynamicsPerhaps the most promising approach uses passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency. It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.\u0026#91;116\u0026#93;\u0026#91;117\u0026#93;Other methods of locomotion[edit]Flying[edit]A modern passenger airliner is essentially a flying robot, with two humans to manage it. The autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey, including takeoff, normal flight, and even landing.\u0026#91;118\u0026#93; Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board, and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions. Some can even fire on targets under command. UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically, without the need for a command from a human. Other flying robots include cruise missiles, the Entomopter, and the Epson micro helicopter robot. Robots such as the Air Penguin, Air Ray, and Air Jelly have lighter-than-air bodies, are propelled by paddles, and are guided by sonar.Biomimetic flying robots (BFRs)[edit]A flapping wing BFR generating lift and thrust.BFRs take inspiration from flying mammals, birds, or insects. BFRs can have flapping wings, which generate the lift and thrust, or they can be propeller actuated. BFRs with flapping wings have increased stroke efficiencies, increased maneuverability, and reduced energy consumption in comparison to propeller actuated BFRs.\u0026#91;119\u0026#93; Mammal and bird inspired BFRs share similar flight characteristics and design considerations. For instance, both mammal and bird inspired BFRs minimize edge fluttering and pressure-induced wingtip curl by increasing the rigidity of the wing edge and wingtips. Mammal and insect inspired BFRs can be impact resistant, making them useful in cluttered environments.Mammal inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from bats, but the flying squirrel has also inspired a prototype.\u0026#91;120\u0026#93; Examples of bat inspired BFRs include Bat Bot\u0026#91;121\u0026#93; and the DALER.\u0026#91;122\u0026#93; Mammal inspired BFRs can be designed to be multi-modal; therefore, they're capable of both flight and terrestrial movement. To reduce the impact of landing, shock absorbers can be implemented along the wings.\u0026#91;122\u0026#93; Alternatively, the BFR can pitch up and increase the amount of drag it experiences.\u0026#91;120\u0026#93; By increasing the drag force, the BFR will decelerate and minimize the impact upon grounding. Different land gait patterns can also be implemented.\u0026#91;120\u0026#93;Dragonfly inspired BFR.Bird inspired BFRs can take inspiration from raptors, gulls, and everything in-between. Bird inspired BFRs can be feathered to increase the angle of attack range over which the prototype can operate before stalling.\u0026#91;123\u0026#93; The wings of bird inspired BFRs allow for in-plane deformation, and the in-plane wing deformation can be adjusted to maximize flight efficiency depending on the flight gait.\u0026#91;123\u0026#93; An example of a raptor inspired BFR is the prototype by Savastano et al.\u0026#91;124\u0026#93; The prototype has fully deformable flapping wings and is capable of carrying a payload of up to 0.8\u0026#160;kg while performing a parabolic climb, steep descent, and rapid recovery. The gull inspired prototype by Grant et al. accurately mimics the elbow and wrist rotation of gulls, and they find that lift generation is maximized when the elbow and wrist deformations are opposite but equal.\u0026#91;125\u0026#93;Insect inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from beetles or dragonflies. An example of a beetle inspired BFR is the prototype by Phan and Park,\u0026#91;126\u0026#93; and a dragonfly inspired BFR is the prototype by Hu et al.\u0026#91;127\u0026#93; The flapping frequency of insect inspired BFRs are much higher than those of other BFRs; this is because of the aerodynamics of insect flight.\u0026#91;128\u0026#93; Insect inspired BFRs are much smaller than those inspired by mammals or birds, so they are more suitable for dense environments.Biologically-inspired flying robots[edit]Visualization of entomopter flying on Mars (NASA)A class of robots that are biologically inspired, but which do not attempt to mimic biology, are creations such as the Entomopter.  Funded by DARPA, NASA, the United States Air Force, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute and patented by Prof. Robert C. Michelson for covert terrestrial missions as well as flight in the lower Mars atmosphere, the Entomopter flight propulsion system uses low Reynolds number wings similar to those of the hawk moth (Manduca sexta), but flaps them in a non-traditional \"opposed x-wing fashion\" while \"blowing\" the surface to enhance lift based on the Coandă effect as well as to control vehicle attitude and direction.  Waste gas from the propulsion system not only facilitates the blown wing aerodynamics, but also serves to create ultrasonic emissions like that of a Bat for obstacle avoidance.  The Entomopter and other biologically-inspired robots leverage features of biological systems, but do not attempt to create mechanical analogs.Snaking[edit]Two robot snakes. The left one has 64 motors (with 2 degrees of freedom per segment), the right one 10.Several snake robots have been successfully developed. Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings.\u0026#91;129\u0026#93; The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robot\u0026#91;130\u0026#93; can even navigate both on land and in water.\u0026#91;131\u0026#93;Skating[edit]A small number of skating robots have been developed, one of which is a multi-mode walking and skating device. It has four legs, with unpowered wheels, which can either step or roll.\u0026#91;132\u0026#93; Another robot, Plen, can use a miniature skateboard or roller-skates, and skate across a desktop.\u0026#91;133\u0026#93;Capuchin, a climbing robotClimbing[edit]Several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces. One approach mimics the movements of a human climber on a wall with protrusions; adjusting the center of mass and moving each limb in turn to gain leverage. An example of this is Capuchin,\u0026#91;134\u0026#93; built by Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University, California. Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall-climbing geckoes, which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass. Examples of this approach include Wallbot\u0026#91;135\u0026#93; and Stickybot.\u0026#91;136\u0026#93;China's Technology Daily reported on 15 November 2008, that Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd. had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named \"Speedy Freelander\". According to Yeung, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling. It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials. It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically. Its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko. A third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole.\u0026#91;76\u0026#93;Swimming (Piscine)[edit]It is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90%.\u0026#91;137\u0026#93; Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man-made boat or submarine, and produce less noise and water disturbance. Therefore, many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion.\u0026#91;138\u0026#93; Notable examples are the Essex University Computer Science Robotic Fish G9,\u0026#91;139\u0026#93; and the Robot Tuna built by the Institute of Field Robotics, to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion.\u0026#91;140\u0026#93; The Aqua Penguin,\u0026#91;141\u0026#93; designed and built by Festo of Germany, copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front \"flippers\" of penguins. Festo have also built the Aqua Ray and Aqua Jelly, which emulate the locomotion of manta ray, and jellyfish, respectively.Robotic Fish: iSplash-IIIn 2014, iSplash-II was developed by PhD student Richard James Clapham and Prof. Huosheng Hu at Essex University. It was the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance, the duration that top speed is maintained.\u0026#91;142\u0026#93; This build attained swimming speeds of 11.6BL/s (i.e. 3.7\u0026#160;m/s).\u0026#91;143\u0026#93; The first build, iSplash-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body length carangiform swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform.\u0026#91;144\u0026#93;Sailing[edit]The autonomous sailboat robot VaimosSailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean. A typical sailboat robot is Vaimos\u0026#91;145\u0026#93; built by IFREMER and ENSTA-Bretagne. Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind, the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer, for the communication and for the actuators (to tune the rudder and the sail). If the robot is equipped with solar panels, the robot could theoretically navigate forever. The two main competitions of sailboat robots are WRSC, which takes place every year in Europe, and Sailbot.Environmental interaction and navigation[edit]Main articles: Robotic mapping and Robotic navigationRadar, GPS, and lidar, are all combined to provide proper navigation and obstacle avoidance (vehicle developed for 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge).This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (July 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as ASIMO and Meinü robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, self-controlled cars, Ernst Dickmanns' driverless car, and the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge, are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information, including by a swarm of autonomous robots.\u0026#91;48\u0026#93; Most of these robots employ a GPS navigation device with waypoints, along with radar, sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar, video cameras, and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints.Human-robot interaction[edit]Main article: Human-robot interactionKismet can produce a range of facial expressions.The state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation. Even though the current state of robotics cannot meet the standards of these robots from science-fiction, robotic media characters (e.g., Wall-E, R2-D2) can elicit audience sympathies that increase people's willingness to accept actual robots in the future.\u0026#91;146\u0026#93; Acceptance of social robots is also likely to increase if people can meet a social robot under appropriate conditions. Studies have shown that interacting with a robot by looking at, touching, or even imagining interacting with the robot can reduce negative feelings that some people have about robots before interacting with them.\u0026#91;147\u0026#93; However, if pre-existing negative sentiments are especially strong, interacting with a robot can increase those negative feelings towards robots.\u0026#91;147\u0026#93;Speech recognition[edit]Main article: Speech recognitionInterpreting the continuous flow of sounds coming from a human, in real time, is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability of speech.\u0026#91;148\u0026#93; The same word, spoken by the same person may sound different depending on local acoustics, volume, the previous word, whether or not the speaker has a cold, etc.. It becomes even harder when the speaker has a different accent.\u0026#91;149\u0026#93; Nevertheless, great strides have been made in the field since Davis, Biddulph, and Balashek designed the first \"voice input system\" which recognized \"ten digits spoken by a single user with 100% accuracy\" in 1952.\u0026#91;150\u0026#93; Currently, the best systems can recognize continuous, natural speech, up to 160 words per minute, with an accuracy of 95%.\u0026#91;151\u0026#93; With the help of artificial intelligence, machines nowadays can use people's voice to identify their emotions such as satisfied or angry.\u0026#91;152\u0026#93;Robotic voice[edit]Other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans. For social reasons, synthetic voice proves suboptimal as a communication medium,\u0026#91;153\u0026#93; making it necessary to develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques.\u0026#91;154\u0026#93;\u0026#91;155\u0026#93; An advantage of diphonic branching is the emotion that the robot is programmed to project, can be carried on the voice tape, or phoneme, already pre-programmed onto the voice media. One of the earliest examples is a teaching robot named Leachim developed in 1974 by Michael J. Freeman.\u0026#91;156\u0026#93;\u0026#91;157\u0026#93; Leachim was able to convert digital memory to rudimentary verbal speech on pre-recorded computer discs.\u0026#91;158\u0026#93; It was programmed to teach students in The Bronx, New York.\u0026#91;158\u0026#93;Gestures[edit]Further information: Gesture recognitionOne can imagine, in the future, explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry, or asking directions from a robot police officer. In both of these cases, making hand gestures would aid the verbal descriptions. In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation. In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate \"down the road, then turn right\". It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots.\u0026#91;159\u0026#93; A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.\u0026#91;160\u0026#93;Facial expression[edit]Further information: Emotion recognitionFacial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos).\u0026#91;161\u0026#93; The coating and servos are built on a metal skull. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and body language. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi\u0026#91;162\u0026#93; can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.\u0026#91;163\u0026#93;Artificial emotions[edit]Artificial emotions can also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions or gestures. As can be seen from the movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation. To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program. This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film. These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots. An example of a robot with artificial emotions is Robin the Robot developed by an Armenian IT company Expper Technologies, which uses AI-based peer-to-peer interaction. Its main task is achieving emotional well-being, i.e. overcome stress and anxiety. Robin was trained to analyze facial expressions and use his face to display his emotions given the context. The robot has been tested by kids in US clinics, and observations show that Robin increased the appetite and cheerfulness of children after meeting and talking.\u0026#91;164\u0026#93;Personality[edit]Many of the robots of science fiction have a personality, something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future.\u0026#91;165\u0026#93; Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality:\u0026#91;166\u0026#93;\u0026#91;167\u0026#93; i.e. they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear. One commercial example is Pleo, a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.\u0026#91;168\u0026#93;Social intelligence[edit]The Socially Intelligent Machines Lab of the Georgia Institute of Technology researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots. The aim of the projects is a social robot that learns task and goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of high-level concepts. These new concepts are grounded from low-level continuous sensor data through unsupervised learning, and task goals are subsequently learned using a Bayesian approach. These concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks, resulting in faster learning of those tasks. The results are demonstrated by the robot Curi who can scoop some pasta from a pot onto a plate and serve the sauce on top.\u0026#91;169\u0026#93;Control[edit]Puppet Magnus, a robot-manipulated marionette with complex control systemsExperimental planar robot arm and sensor-based, open-architecture robot controller developed at Sunderland University, UK in 2000RuBot II can manually resolve Rubik's cubes.Further information: Control systemThe mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks.\u0026#91;170\u0026#93; The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, processing, and action (robotic paradigms).\u0026#91;171\u0026#93; Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators (motors), which move the mechanical structure to achieve the required co-ordinated motion or force actions.The processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands (e.g. firing motor power electronic gates based directly upon encoder feedback signals to achieve the required torque/velocity of the shaft). Sensor fusion and internal models may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor) is sometimes inferred from these estimates. Techniques from control theory are generally used to convert the higher-level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators, most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure.\u0026#91;170\u0026#93;\u0026#91;171\u0026#93;\u0026#91;172\u0026#93;At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a \"cognitive\" model. Cognitive models try to represent the robot, the world, and how the two interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects.\u0026#91;170\u0026#93; Mapping techniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally, motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.Modern commercial robotic control systems are highly complex, integrate multiple sensors and effectors, have many interacting degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and require operator interfaces, programming tools and real-time capabilities.\u0026#91;171\u0026#93; They are oftentimes interconnected to wider communication networks and in many cases are now both IoT-enabled and mobile.\u0026#91;173\u0026#93; Progress towards open architecture, layered, user-friendly and 'intelligent' sensor-based interconnected robots has emerged from earlier concepts related to Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), and several 'open or 'hybrid' reference architectures exist which assist developers of robot control software and hardware to move beyond traditional, earlier notions of 'closed' robot control systems have been proposed.\u0026#91;172\u0026#93; Open architecture controllers are said to be better able to meet the growing requirements of a wide range of robot users, including system developers, end users and research scientists, and are better positioned to deliver the advanced robotic concepts related to Industry 4.0.\u0026#91;172\u0026#93; In addition to utilizing many established features of robot controllers, such as position, velocity and force control of end effectors, they also enable IoT interconnection and the implementation of more advanced sensor fusion and control techniques, including adaptive control, Fuzzy control and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based control.\u0026#91;172\u0026#93; When implemented in real-time, such techniques can potentially improve the stability and performance of robots operating in unknown or uncertain environments by enabling the control systems to learn and adapt to environmental changes.\u0026#91;174\u0026#93; There are several examples of reference architectures for robot controllers, and also examples of successful implementations of actual robot controllers developed from them. One example of a generic reference architecture and associated interconnected, open-architecture robot and controller implementation was developed by Michael Short and colleagues at the University of Sunderland in the UK in 2000 (pictured right).\u0026#91;172\u0026#93; The robot was used in a number of research and development studies, including prototype implementation of novel advanced and intelligent control and environment mapping methods in real-time.\u0026#91;174\u0026#93;\u0026#91;175\u0026#93;Autonomy levels[edit]TOPIO, a humanoid robot, played ping pong at Tokyo IREX 2009.\u0026#91;176\u0026#93;Control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy.Direct interaction is used for haptic or teleoperated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.\u0026#91;177\u0026#93;An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time . Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities. For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern.Another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions.Teleoperation. A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator.Supervisory. A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators.Task-level autonomy. The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it.Full autonomy. The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction.Research[edit]Further information: Open-source robotics, Evolutionary robotics, Areas of robotics, and Robotics simulatorTwo Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers stand with three vehicles, providing a size comparison of three generations of Mars rovers. Front and center is the flight spare for the first Mars rover, Sojourner, which landed on Mars in 1997 as part of the Mars Pathfinder Project. On the left is a Mars Exploration Rover (MER) test vehicle that is a working sibling to Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in 2004. On the right is a test rover for the Mars Science Laboratory, which landed Curiosity on Mars in 2012. Sojourner is 65\u0026#160;cm (2.13\u0026#160;ft) long. The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) are 1.6\u0026#160;m (5.2\u0026#160;ft) long. Curiosity on the right is 3\u0026#160;m (9.8\u0026#160;ft) long.Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robots, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them. Other investigations, such as MIT's cyberflora project, are almost wholly academic.A first particular new innovation in robot design is the open sourcing of robot-projects. To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term \"Generation Robots\" can be used. This term is coined by Professor Hans Moravec, Principal Research Scientist at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute in describing the near future evolution of robot technology. First-generation robots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a lizard and should become available by 2010. Because the first generation robot would be incapable of learning, however, Moravec predicts that the second generation robot would be an improvement over the first and become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a mouse. The third generation robot should have intelligence comparable to that of a monkey. Though fourth generation robots, robots with human intelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.\u0026#91;178\u0026#93;The second is evolutionary robots. This is a methodology that uses evolutionary computation to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior controllers. In a similar way to natural evolution, a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using a fitness function. Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners. Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear. This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers. Researchers use this method both to create better robots,\u0026#91;179\u0026#93; and to explore the nature of evolution.\u0026#91;180\u0026#93; Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated,\u0026#91;181\u0026#93; this technique may be run entirely or mostly in simulation, using a robot simulator software package, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough.\u0026#91;182\u0026#93; Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.\u0026#91;citation needed\u0026#93;Dynamics and kinematics[edit]Further information: Kinematics and Dynamics (mechanics).mw-parser-output .infobox-subbox{padding:0;border:none;margin:-3px;width:auto;min-width:100%;font-size:100%;clear:none;float:none;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .infobox-3cols-child{margin:auto}.mw-parser-output .infobox .navbar{font-size:100%}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-header,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-subheader,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-above,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-title,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-image,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-full-data,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-below{text-align:center}External video How the BB-8 Sphero Toy WorksThe study of motion can be divided into kinematics and dynamics.\u0026#91;183\u0026#93; Direct kinematics or forward kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics, methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot. Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.In each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for \"optimal\" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented.Bionics and biomimetics[edit]Bionics and biomimetics apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots.  For example, the design of BionicKangaroo was based on the way kangaroos jump.Quantum computing[edit]There has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly on quantum computers than they can be run on digital computers. This area has been referred to as quantum robotics.\u0026#91;184\u0026#93;Education and training[edit]Main article: Educational roboticsThe SCORBOT-ER 4u educational robotRobotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.\u0026#91;185\u0026#93; Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, particularly in parts of the USA,\u0026#91;186\u0026#93; as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence, and robotics among students.Employment[edit]A robot technician builds small all-terrain robots (courtesy: MobileRobots,  Inc.).Main article: Technological unemploymentRobotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments. As factories increase their use of robots, the number of robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising.\u0026#91;187\u0026#93; The employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long-term investment for benefactors. A paper by Michael Osborne and\u0026#160;Carl Benedikt Frey\u0026#160;found that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk to automation \"over some unspecified number of years\".\u0026#91;188\u0026#93; These claims have been criticized on the ground that social policy, not AI, causes unemployment.\u0026#91;189\u0026#93; In a 2016 article in The Guardian, Stephen Hawking stated \"The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining\".\u0026#91;190\u0026#93;According to a GlobalData September 2021 report, the robotics industry was worth $45bn in 2020, and by 2030, it will have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% to $568bn, driving jobs in robotics and related industries.\u0026#91;191\u0026#93;Occupational safety and health implications[edit]Main article: Workplace robotics safetyA discussion paper drawn up by EU-OSHA highlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health (OSH).\u0026#91;192\u0026#93;The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments. In space, defense, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.\u0026#91;193\u0026#93;Moreover, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the \"man-robot merger\". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programs and trying to promote a safe and flexible cooperation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic \"human-robot collaboration\".In the future, cooperation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms. Current approaches and technical standards\u0026#91;194\u0026#93;\u0026#91;195\u0026#93; aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will have to be revised.User experience[edit]Great user experience predicts the needs, experiences, behaviors, language and cognitive abilities, and other factors of each user group. It then uses these insights to produce a product or solution that is ultimately useful and usable. For robots, user experience begins with an understanding of the robot's intended task and environment, while considering any possible social impact the robot may have on human operations and interactions with it.\u0026#91;196\u0026#93;It defines that communication as the transmission of information through signals, which are elements perceived through touch, sound, smell and sight.\u0026#91;197\u0026#93; The author states that the signal connects the sender to the receiver and consists of three parts: the signal itself, what it refers to, and the interpreter. Body postures and gestures, facial expressions, hand and head movements are all part of nonverbal behavior and communication. Robots are no exception when it comes to human-robot interaction. Therefore, humans use their verbal and nonverbal behaviors to communicate their defining characteristics. Similarly, social robots need this coordination to perform human-like behaviors.See also[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul{line-height:inherit;list-style:none;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol li,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul li{margin-bottom:0}Artificial IntelligenceAutonomous robotCloud roboticsCognitive roboticsEvolutionary roboticsFog roboticsGlossary of roboticsIndex of robotics articlesMechatronicsMulti-agent systemOutline of roboticsQuantum RoboticsRoboethicsRobot rightsRobotic artRobotic governanceSoft roboticsSelf-reconfiguring modular robotNotes[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^ One database, developed by the United States Department of Energy contains information on almost 500 existing robotic technologies.\u0026#91;46\u0026#93;References[edit]^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}\"German National Library\".

For software agents, see Bot. For other uses of the term, see Robot (disambiguation).ASIMO (2000) at the Expo 2005Articulated welding robots used in a factory are a type of industrial robot.The quadrupedal military robot Cheetah, an evolution of BigDog (pictured), was clocked as the world's fastest legged robot in 2012, beating the record set by an MIT bipedal robot in 1989.\u0026#91;1\u0026#93;A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,\u0026#91;4\u0026#93; as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.From the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling humans and other animals, such as animatronics, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control.The term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti – Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor.\u0026#91;5\u0026#93;\u0026#91;6\u0026#93;\u0026#91;7\u0026#93; Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen.The first modern digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and spawned his seminal robotics company, Unimation. The first Unimate was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it lifted pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey.\u0026#91;8\u0026#93;Robots have replaced humans\u0026#91;9\u0026#93; in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.\u0026#91;10\u0026#93; The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future..mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Summary.mw-parser-output .tmulti .multiimageinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle .thumbcaption{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow\u003e.thumbcaption{text-align:center}}Anthropomorphism in robots:KITT (a fictional robot) is mentally anthropomorphic; it thinks like a human.iCub is physically anthropomorphic; it looks like a human.The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots.\u0026#91;11\u0026#93; There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals.\u0026#91;12\u0026#93;\u0026#91;13\u0026#93; Related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology, which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to living things than to machines.HistoryMain article: History of robotsThe idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China,\u0026#91;14\u0026#93; Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt,\u0026#91;15\u0026#93; attempted to build self-operating machines, some resembling animals and humans. Early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of Archytas,\u0026#91;16\u0026#93; the artificial birds of Mozi and Lu Ban,\u0026#91;17\u0026#93; a \"speaking\" automaton by Hero of Alexandria, a washstand automaton by Philo of Byzantium, and a human automaton described in the Lie Zi.\u0026#91;14\u0026#93;Early beginningsMany ancient mythologies, and most modern religions include artificial people, such as the mechanical servants built by the Greek god Hephaestus\u0026#91;18\u0026#93; (Vulcan to the Romans), the clay golems of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend, and Galatea, the mythical statue of Pygmalion that came to life. Since circa 400 BC, myths of Crete include Talos, a man of bronze who guarded the island from pirates.In ancient Greece, the Greek engineer Ctesibius (c. 270 BC) \"applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures.\"\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;\u0026#58;\u0026#8202;2\u0026#8202;\u0026#91;20\u0026#93; In the 4th century BC, the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum postulated a mechanical steam-operated bird he called \"The Pigeon\". Hero of Alexandria (10–70 AD), a Greek mathematician and inventor, created numerous user-configurable automated devices, and described machines powered by air pressure, steam and water.\u0026#91;21\u0026#93;Al-Jazari – a musical toyThe 11th century Lokapannatti tells of how the Buddha's relics were protected by mechanical robots (bhuta vahana yanta), from the kingdom of Roma visaya (Rome); until they were disarmed by King Ashoka.\u0026#91;22\u0026#93;In ancient China, the 3rd-century text of the Lie Zi describes an account of humanoid automata, involving a much earlier encounter between Chinese emperor King Mu of Zhou and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an 'artificer'. Yan Shi proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical 'handiwork' made of leather, wood, and artificial organs.\u0026#91;14\u0026#93; There are also accounts of flying automata in the Han Fei Zi and other texts, which attributes the 5th century BC Mohist philosopher Mozi and his contemporary Lu Ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds (ma yuan) that could successfully fly.\u0026#91;17\u0026#93;Su Song's astronomical clock tower showing the mechanical figurines which chimed the hours In 1066, the Chinese inventor Su Song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours.\u0026#91;23\u0026#93;\u0026#91;24\u0026#93;\u0026#91;25\u0026#93; His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations.\u0026#91;25\u0026#93;Samarangana Sutradhara, a Sanskrit treatise by Bhoja (11th century), includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances (automata), including mechanical bees and birds, fountains shaped like humans and animals, and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps, danced, played instruments, and re-enacted scenes from Hindu mythology.\u0026#91;26\u0026#93;\u0026#91;27\u0026#93;\u0026#91;28\u0026#93;13th century Muslim scientist Ismail al-Jazari created several automated devices. He built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower.\u0026#91;29\u0026#93; He also invented the earliest known automatic gates, which were driven by hydropower,\u0026#91;30\u0026#93; created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks.\u0026#91;31\u0026#93; One of al-Jazari's humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water, tea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink.\u0026#91;32\u0026#93; Al-Jazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets. It features a female humanoid automaton standing by a basin filled with water. When the user pulls the lever, the water drains and the female automaton refills the basin.\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;Mark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers, especially al-Jazari, as follows:Unlike the Greek designs, these Arab examples reveal an interest, not only in dramatic illusion, but in manipulating the environment for human comfort. Thus, the greatest contribution the Arabs made, besides preserving, disseminating and building on the work of the Greeks, was the concept of practical application. This was the key element that was missing in Greek robotic science.\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;\u0026#58;\u0026#8202;9\u0026#8202;Model of Leonardo's robot with inner workings. Possibly constructed by Leonardo da Vinci around 1495.\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; In the 14th century, the coronation of Richard II of England featured an automata angel.\u0026#91;34\u0026#93;In Renaissance Italy, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495.  Da Vinci's notebooks, rediscovered in the 1950s, contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as Leonardo's robot, able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw.\u0026#91;35\u0026#93; The design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his Vitruvian Man. It is not known whether he attempted to build it. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of al-Jazari.\u0026#91;29\u0026#93;In Japan, complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries, with many described in the 18th century Karakuri zui (Illustrated Machinery, 1796). One such automaton was the karakuri ningyō, a mechanized puppet.\u0026#91;36\u0026#93; Different variations of the karakuri existed: the Butai karakuri, which were used in theatre, the Zashiki karakuri, which were small and used in homes, and the Dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals, where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends.In France, between 1738 and 1739, Jacques de Vaucanson exhibited several life-sized automatons: a flute player, a pipe player and a duck.  The mechanical duck could flap its wings, crane its neck, and swallow food from the exhibitor's hand, and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment.\u0026#91;37\u0026#93;  About 30 years later in Switzerland the clockmaker Pierre Jaquet-Droz made several complex mechanical figures that could write and play music.  Several of these devices still exist and work.\u0026#91;38\u0026#93;Remote-controlled systemsThe Brennan torpedo, one of the earliest 'guided missiles'Remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes. The early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by John Ericsson (pneumatic), John Louis Lay (electric wire guided), and Victor von Scheliha (electric wire guided).\u0026#91;39\u0026#93;The Brennan torpedo, invented by Louis Brennan in 1877, was powered by two contra-rotating propellers that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo. Differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target, making it \"the world's first practical guided missile\".\u0026#91;40\u0026#93; In 1897 the British inventor Ernest Wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by \"Hertzian\" (radio) waves\u0026#91;41\u0026#93;\u0026#91;42\u0026#93; and in 1898 Nikola Tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless-controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the US Navy.\u0026#91;43\u0026#93;\u0026#91;44\u0026#93;In 1903, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo demonstrated a radio control system called \"Telekino\" at the Paris Academy of Sciences,\u0026#91;45\u0026#93; which he wanted to use to control an airship of his own design. He obtained some patents in other countries.\u0026#91;46\u0026#93; Unlike the previous mechanisms, which carried out actions of the 'on/off' type, Torres developed a system for controlling any mechanical or electrical device with different states of operation.\u0026#91;47\u0026#93; The transmitter was capable of sending a family of different codewords by means of a binary telegraph signal to the receiver, which was able to set up a different state of operation in the device being used, depending on the codeword. Specifically, it was able to do up to 19 different actions.\u0026#91;48\u0026#93;\u0026#91;49\u0026#93;Archibald Low, known as the \"father of radio guidance systems\" for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the First World War. In 1917, he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the Royal Flying Corps and in the same year built the first wire-guided rocket.Early robotsW. H. Richards with \"George\", 1932In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots, Eric, was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London, where it delivered a speech. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot's frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve-volt power source. The robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control.\u0026#91;50\u0026#93; Both Eric and his \"brother\" George toured the world.\u0026#91;51\u0026#93;Westinghouse Electric Corporation built Televox in 1926; it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off. In 1939, the humanoid robot known as Elektro was debuted at the 1939 New York World's Fair.\u0026#91;52\u0026#93;\u0026#91;53\u0026#93; Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120.2\u0026#160;kg), it could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm record player), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move its head and arms. The body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. In 1928, Japan's first robot, Gakutensoku, was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura.The German V-1 flying bomb was equipped with systems for automatic guidance and range control, flying on a predetermined course (which could include a 90-degree turn) and entering a terminal dive after a predetermined distance. It was reported as being a 'robot' in contemporary descriptions \u0026#91;54\u0026#93;Modern autonomous robotsThe first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation.  His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden.  Modern incarnations of Walter's turtles may be found in the form of BEAM robotics.\u0026#91;55\u0026#93;U.S. Patent 2,988,237, issued in 1961 to DevolThe first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate. This ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry.\u0026#91;56\u0026#93; Devol sold the first Unimate to General Motors in 1960, and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in Trenton, New Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them.\u0026#91;57\u0026#93; Devol's patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry.\u0026#91;58\u0026#93;The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company.\u0026#91;59\u0026#93; In 1973, a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented\u0026#91;60\u0026#93;\u0026#91;61\u0026#93;\u0026#91;62\u0026#93; by KUKA robotics in Germany, and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976, and the design was sold to Unimation.Commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs which are too dirty, dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly and packing, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial goods.\u0026#91;63\u0026#93;Future development and trends.mw-parser-output .infobox-subbox{padding:0;border:none;margin:-3px;width:auto;min-width:100%;font-size:100%;clear:none;float:none;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .infobox-3cols-child{margin:auto}.mw-parser-output .infobox .navbar{font-size:100%}body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-header,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-subheader,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-above,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-title,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-image,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-full-data,body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .infobox-below{text-align:center}External video Atlas, The Next GenerationFurther information: RoboticsVarious techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One method is evolutionary robotics, in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent \"generation\" of robots. Another method is developmental robotics, which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem-solving and other functions. Another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named RoboHon.\u0026#91;64\u0026#93;As robots become more advanced, eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots. Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source software set of programs being developed at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Technical University of Munich, Germany, among others. ROS provides ways to program a robot's navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved. It also provides high-level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors. When ROS boots up on a robot's computer, it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots' limbs. It would relay this data to higher-level algorithms. Microsoft is also developing a \"Windows for robots\" system with its Robotics Developer Studio, which has been available since 2007.\u0026#91;65\u0026#93;Japan hopes to have full-scale commercialization of service robots by 2025. Much technological research in Japan is led by Japanese government agencies, particularly the Trade Ministry.\u0026#91;66\u0026#93;Many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people, even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction.\u0026#91;67\u0026#93;\u0026#91;68\u0026#93; As early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would:\u0026#91;69\u0026#93; 1. Clean parts by removing molding flash 2. Spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3. Pack things in boxes—for example, orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4.

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.  (August 2021)In 2008, Caterpillar Inc. developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator.\u0026#91;70\u0026#93; Many analysts believe that self-driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics.\u0026#91;71\u0026#93; By 2014, Caterpillar had a self-driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining. In 2015, these Caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in Australia by the mining company Rio Tinto Coal Australia.\u0026#91;72\u0026#93;\u0026#91;73\u0026#93;\u0026#91;74\u0026#93;\u0026#91;75\u0026#93; Some analysts believe that within the next few decades, most trucks will be self-driving.\u0026#91;76\u0026#93;A literate or 'reading robot' named Marge has intelligence that comes from software. She can read newspapers, find and correct misspelled words, learn about banks like Barclays, and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others.\u0026#91;77\u0026#93;Baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding to be used. This means Baxter needs no programming to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.\u0026#91;78\u0026#93;Prototype cooking robots have been developed and could be programmed for autonomous, dynamic and adjustable preparation of discrete meals.\u0026#91;79\u0026#93;\u0026#91;80\u0026#93;EtymologySee also: Glossary of roboticsA scene from Karel Čapek's 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), showing three robotsThe word robot was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93; The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called robots. The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans).Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother, the painter and writer Josef Čapek, as its actual originator.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93;In an article in the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři (\"workers\", from Latin labor). However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested \"roboti\". The word robota means literally \"corvée\", \"serf labor\", and figuratively \"drudgery\" or \"hard work\" in Czech and also (more general) \"work\", \"labor\" in many Slavic languages (e.g.: Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Polish, Macedonian, Ukrainian, archaic Czech, as well as robot in Hungarian). Traditionally the robota (Hungarian robot) was the work period a serf (corvée) had to give for his lord, typically 6 months of the year. The origin of the word is the Old Church Slavonic rabota \"servitude\" (\"work\" in contemporary Bulgarian, Macedonian and Russian), which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *orbh-. Robot is cognate with the German root Arbeit (work).\u0026#91;81\u0026#93;\u0026#91;82\u0026#93;English pronunciation of the word has evolved relatively quickly since its introduction. In the U.S. during the late 1930s to early 1940s the second syllable was pronounced with a long \"O\" like \"row-boat.\"\u0026#91;83\u0026#93;\u0026#91;better\u0026#160;source\u0026#160;needed\u0026#93; By the late 1950s to early 1960s, some were pronouncing it with a short \"U\" like \"row-but\" while others used a softer \"O\" like \"row-bought.\"\u0026#91;84\u0026#93; By the 1970s, its current pronunciation \"row-bot\" had become predominant.The word robotics, used to describe this field of study,\u0026#91;4\u0026#93; was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov created the \"Three Laws of Robotics\" which are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction. (The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. \"People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. If you read the short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical,\" said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath.\u0026#91;85\u0026#93;)Modern robotsA laparoscopic robotic surgery machineMobile robotMain articles: Mobile robot and Automated guided vehicleMobile robots\u0026#91;86\u0026#93; have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location. An example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle (AGV). An AGV is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision or lasers.\u0026#91;87\u0026#93; AGVs are discussed later in this article.Mobile robots are also found in industry, military and security environments.\u0026#91;88\u0026#93; They also appear as consumer products, for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning. Mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research.\u0026#91;89\u0026#93;Mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference. Because of this most humans rarely encounter robots. However domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries. Robots can also be found in military applications.\u0026#91;90\u0026#93;Industrial robots (manipulating)Main articles: Industrial robot and Manipulator (device)A pick and place robot in a factoryIndustrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm (multi-linked manipulator) and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface. One of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly.The International Organization for Standardization gives a definition of a  manipulating industrial robot in ISO 8373:\"an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.\"\u0026#91;91\u0026#93;This definition is used by the International Federation of Robotics, the European Robotics Research Network (EURON) and many national standards committees.\u0026#91;92\u0026#93;Service robotMain article: Service robotMost commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods. The term \"service robot\" is less well-defined. The International Federation of Robotics has proposed a tentative definition, \"A service robot is a robot which operates semi- or fully  autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans and equipment, excluding manufacturing operations.\"\u0026#91;93\u0026#93;Educational (interactive) robotsMain article: Educational roboticsRobots are used as educational assistants to teachers. From the 1980s, robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the Logo language.\u0026#91;94\u0026#93;\u0026#91;95\u0026#93;There are robot kits like Lego Mindstorms, BIOLOID, OLLO from ROBOTIS, or BotBrain Educational Robots can help children to learn about mathematics, physics, programming, and electronics. Robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Tech Challenge, FIRST Lego League Challenge and FIRST Lego League Explore competitions.There have also been robots such as the teaching computer, Leachim (1974).\u0026#91;96\u0026#93; Leachim was an early example of speech synthesis using the using the Diphone synthesis method. 2-XL (1976) was a robot shaped game / teaching toy based on branching between audible tracks on an 8-track tape player, both invented by Michael J. Freeman.\u0026#91;97\u0026#93; Later, the 8-track was upgraded to tape cassettes and then to digital.Modular robotMain article: Self-reconfiguring modular robotModular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the use of robots by modularizing their architecture.\u0026#91;98\u0026#93; The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of a single type of identical, several different identical module types, or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the programming, inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots. Modular robots may be composed of L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U and H shaped modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems. These \"ANAT robots\" can be designed with \"n\" DOF as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain, and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom. The more modules that are connected to one another, the more degrees of freedom it will have. L-shaped modules can also be designed in a chain, and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases, as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases. Modular robots can be manually or self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different applications. Because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots, a snake-arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra-arm robot, or can split into several mobile robots, and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones, or combine with others into a larger or different one. This allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task, as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks.Modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation,\u0026#91;99\u0026#93; industrial automation,\u0026#91;100\u0026#93; duct cleaning\u0026#91;101\u0026#93; and handling. Many research centres and universities have also studied this technology, and have developed prototypes.Collaborative robotsA collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks. However, end-effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards, and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion-control application.\u0026#91;102\u0026#93;The collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by Universal Robots in Denmark.\u0026#91;103\u0026#93;Rethink Robotics—founded by Rodney Brooks, previously with iRobot—introduced Baxter in September 2012; as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers, and be programmable for performing simple tasks.\u0026#91;104\u0026#93; Baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches. Intended for sale to small businesses, they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer.\u0026#91;105\u0026#93; As of May\u0026#160;2014\u0026#91;update\u0026#93;, 190 companies in the US have bought Baxters and they are being used commercially in the UK.\u0026#91;10\u0026#93;Robots in societyTOPIO, a humanoid robot, played ping pong at Tokyo International Robot Exhibition (IREX) 2009.\u0026#91;106\u0026#93;\u0026#91;107\u0026#93;Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America, 1% in Australasia and 1% in Africa.\u0026#91;108\u0026#93; 40% of all the robots in the world are in Japan,\u0026#91;109\u0026#93; making Japan the country with the highest number of robots.Autonomy and ethical questionsMain articles: Roboethics and Ethics of artificial intelligenceAn android, or robot designed to resemble a human, can appear comforting to some people and disturbing to others.\u0026#91;110\u0026#93;As robots have become more advanced and sophisticated, experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots' behavior,\u0026#91;111\u0026#93;\u0026#91;112\u0026#93; and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social, cultural, ethical or legal rights.\u0026#91;113\u0026#93; One scientific team has said that it was possible that a robot brain would exist by 2019.\u0026#91;114\u0026#93; Others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050.\u0026#91;115\u0026#93; Recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated.\u0026#91;116\u0026#93; The social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called Plug \u0026amp; Pray.\u0026#91;117\u0026#93;Vernor Vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans. He calls this \"the Singularity\".\u0026#91;118\u0026#93; He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.\u0026#91;119\u0026#93; This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism.In 2009, experts attended a conference hosted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy, and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence.\" They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.\u0026#91;118\u0026#93; Various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns.\u0026#91;120\u0026#93;\u0026#91;121\u0026#93;\u0026#91;122\u0026#93;Military robotsSome experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.\u0026#91;123\u0026#93; There are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots.\u0026#91;124\u0026#93; The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that, as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.\u0026#91;125\u0026#93;\u0026#91;126\u0026#93; One researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane, as they could make decisions more effectively. However, other experts question this.\u0026#91;127\u0026#93;One robot in particular, the EATR, has generated public concerns\u0026#91;128\u0026#93; over its fuel source, as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances.\u0026#91;129\u0026#93; Although the engine for the EATR is designed to run on biomass and vegetation\u0026#91;130\u0026#93; specifically selected by its sensors, which it can find on battlefields or other local environments, the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used.\u0026#91;131\u0026#93;Manuel De Landa has noted that \"smart missiles\" and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots, as they make some of their decisions autonomously. He believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines.\u0026#91;132\u0026#93;Relationship to unemploymentMain article: Technological unemploymentFor centuries, people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment, although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy.\u0026#91;133\u0026#93;\u0026#91;134\u0026#93;\u0026#91;135\u0026#93;A recent example of human replacement involves Taiwanese technology company Foxconn who, in July 2011, announced a three-year plan to replace workers with more robots. At present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three-year period.\u0026#91;136\u0026#93;Lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws.\u0026#91;137\u0026#93;Kevin J. Delaney said \"Robots are taking human jobs. But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies' use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment.\"\u0026#91;138\u0026#93; The robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers.The World Bank's World Development Report 2019 puts forth evidence showing that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.\u0026#91;139\u0026#93;Contemporary usesA general-purpose robot acts as a guide during the day and a security guard at night.See also: List of robotsAt present, there are two main types of robots, based on their use: general-purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots.Robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose. A robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well, or a range of tasks less well. All robots by their nature can be re-programmed to behave differently, but some are limited by their physical form. For example, a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting, welding, gluing, or acting as a fairground ride, while a pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards.General-purpose autonomous robotsMain article: Autonomous robotGeneral-purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently. General-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces, handle their own re-charging needs, interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks. Like computers, general-purpose robots can link with networks, software and accessories that increase their usefulness. They may recognize people or objects, talk, provide companionship, monitor environmental quality, respond to alarms, pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks. General-purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day. Some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance; this type of robot is called a humanoid robot. Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage, as no humanoid robot can, as of yet, actually navigate around a room that it has never been in.\u0026#91;140\u0026#93; Thus, humanoid robots are really quite limited, despite their intelligent behaviors in their well-known environments.Factory robotsCar productionOver the last three decades, automobile factories have become dominated by robots. A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.  On an automated production line, a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded, glued, painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations.PackagingIndustrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods, for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes, or for loading and unloading machining centers.ElectronicsMass-produced printed circuit boards (PCBs) are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots, typically with SCARA manipulators, which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.\u0026#91;141\u0026#93; Such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour, far out-performing a human in speed, accuracy, and reliability.\u0026#91;142\u0026#93;Automated guided vehicles (AGVs)An intelligent AGV drops-off goods without needing lines or beacons in the workspace.Mobile robots, following markers or wires in the floor, or using vision\u0026#91;87\u0026#93; or lasers, are used to transport goods around large facilities, such as warehouses, container ports, or hospitals.\u0026#91;143\u0026#93;Early AGV-style robotsLimited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time. Very little feedback or intelligence was required, and the robots needed only the most basic exteroceptors (sensors). The limitations of these AGVs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them. If one AGV breaks down, it may stop the entire operation.Interim AGV technologiesDeveloped to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling. In most factories, triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance, such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes. Also, if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred, AGVs may become lost. Often such AGVs are designed to be used in human-free environments.Intelligent AGVs (i-AGVs)Such as SmartLoader,\u0026#91;144\u0026#93; SpeciMinder,\u0026#91;145\u0026#93; ADAM,\u0026#91;146\u0026#93; Tug\u0026#91;147\u0026#93; Eskorta,\u0026#91;148\u0026#93; and MT 400 with Motivity\u0026#91;149\u0026#93; are designed for people-friendly workspaces. They navigate by recognizing natural features. 3D scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead-reckoning calculations of the AGV's current position.  Some AGVs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses. For dynamic areas, such as warehouses full of pallets, AGVs require additional strategies using three-dimensional sensors such as time-of-flight or stereovision cameras.Dirty, dangerous, dull, or inaccessible tasksSee also: Dirty, dangerous and demeaningThere are many jobs that humans would rather leave to robots. The job may be boring, such as domestic cleaning or sports field line marking, or dangerous, such as exploring inside a volcano.\u0026#91;150\u0026#93; Other jobs are physically inaccessible, such as exploring another planet,\u0026#91;151\u0026#93; cleaning the inside of a long pipe, or performing laparoscopic surgery.\u0026#91;152\u0026#93;Space probesAlmost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot.\u0026#91;153\u0026#93;\u0026#91;154\u0026#93; Some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities, but their ability to fly and land (in the case of Luna 9) is an indication of their status as a robot. This includes the Voyager probes and the Galileo probes, among others.TelerobotsA U.S. Marine Corps technician prepares to use a telerobot to detonate a buried improvised explosive device near Camp Fallujah, Iraq.Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time.\u0026#91;152\u0026#93; They can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it. Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely.\u0026#91;155\u0026#93; Teleoperated robot aircraft, like the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, are increasingly being used by the military. These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets.\u0026#91;156\u0026#93;\u0026#91;157\u0026#93; Hundreds of robots such as iRobot's Packbot and the Foster-Miller TALON are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).\u0026#91;158\u0026#93;Automated fruit harvesting machinesRobots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers.Domestic robotsThe Roomba domestic vacuum cleaner robot does a single, menial job.Domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use. They are used in simple but often disliked jobs, such as vacuum cleaning, floor washing, and lawn mowing. An example of a domestic robot is a Roomba.Military robotsMain article: Military robotMilitary robots include the SWORDS robot which is currently used in ground-based combat. It can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations.\u0026#91;159\u0026#93;\u0026#91;160\u0026#93;\u0026#91;161\u0026#93;Unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs), which are an upgraded form of UAVs, can do a wide variety of missions, including combat. UCAVs are being designed such as the BAE Systems Mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves, to pick their own course and target, and to make most decisions on their own.\u0026#91;162\u0026#93; The BAE Taranis is a UCAV built by Great Britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection.\u0026#91;163\u0026#93; Flight trials are expected to begin in 2011.\u0026#91;164\u0026#93;The AAAI has studied this topic in depth\u0026#91;111\u0026#93; and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue.\u0026#91;165\u0026#93;Some have suggested a need to build \"Friendly AI\", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.\u0026#91;166\u0026#93; Several such measures reportedly already exist, with robot-heavy countries such as Japan and South Korea\u0026#91;167\u0026#93; having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems, and possibly sets of 'laws' akin to Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics.\u0026#91;168\u0026#93;\u0026#91;169\u0026#93; An official report was issued in 2009 by the Japanese government's Robot Industry Policy Committee.\u0026#91;170\u0026#93; Chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules, and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as \"Robot Legal Studies.\"\u0026#91;171\u0026#93; Some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods.\u0026#91;172\u0026#93;Mining robotsMining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry, including skills shortages, improving productivity from declining ore grades, and achieving environmental targets. Due to the hazardous nature of mining, in particular underground mining, the prevalence of autonomous, semi-autonomous, and tele-operated robots has greatly increased in recent times. A number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains, trucks and loaders that will load material, transport it on the mine site to its destination, and unload without requiring human intervention. One of the world's largest mining corporations, Rio Tinto, has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world's largest, consisting of 150 autonomous Komatsu trucks, operating in Western Australia.\u0026#91;173\u0026#93; Similarly, BHP has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world's largest, 21 autonomous Atlas Copco drills.\u0026#91;174\u0026#93;Drilling, longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots.\u0026#91;175\u0026#93; The Atlas Copco Rig Control System can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig, moving the rig into position using GPS, set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths.\u0026#91;176\u0026#93; Similarly, the Transmin Rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination.\u0026#91;177\u0026#93; These systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations.HealthcareRobots in healthcare have two main functions. Those which assist an individual, such as a sufferer of a disease like Multiple Sclerosis, and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals.Home automation for the elderly and disabledFurther information: Disability robotThe Care-Providing Robot FRIENDRobots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants, such as the Handy 1,\u0026#91;178\u0026#93; through to semi-autonomous robots, such as FRIEND which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks.The population is aging in many countries, especially Japan, meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for, but relatively fewer young people to care for them.\u0026#91;179\u0026#93;\u0026#91;180\u0026#93; Humans make the best carers, but where they are unavailable, robots are gradually being introduced.\u0026#91;181\u0026#93;FRIEND is a semi-autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities, like preparing and serving a meal. FRIEND make it possible for patients who are paraplegic, have muscle diseases or serious paralysis (due to strokes etc.), to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff.PharmaciesMain article: Pharmacy automationThis section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources\u0026#32;in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (July 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Script Pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form.\u0026#91;182\u0026#93;\u0026#91;better\u0026#160;source\u0026#160;needed\u0026#93; The pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient's medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it's the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up.McKesson's Robot RX is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors.\u0026#91;183\u0026#93; The robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses. The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry. It uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to either its stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications. During this process it uses barcode technology to verify it's pulling the correct drug. It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks, the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor.Research robotsSee also: Robotics researchWhile most robots today are installed in factories or homes, performing labour or life saving jobs, many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world. Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robot, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them. It is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized.\u0026#91;citation needed\u0026#93;Bionic and biomimetic robotsFurther information: BiomimeticsFurther information: BionicsOne approach to designing robots is to base them on animals. BionicKangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo.NanorobotsFurther information: NanoroboticsNanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Also known as \"nanobots\" or \"nanites\", they would be constructed from molecular machines. So far, researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems, such as bearings, sensors, and synthetic molecular motors, but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the Nanobot Robocup contest.\u0026#91;184\u0026#93; Researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria, which could perform tasks on a tiny scale. Possible applications include micro surgery (on the level of individual cells), utility fog,\u0026#91;185\u0026#93; manufacturing, weaponry and cleaning.\u0026#91;186\u0026#93; Some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce, the earth would turn into \"grey goo\", while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense.\u0026#91;187\u0026#93;\u0026#91;188\u0026#93;Reconfigurable robotsMain article: Self-reconfiguring modular robotA few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task,\u0026#91;189\u0026#93; like the fictional T-1000. Real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however, and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units, which can move relative to their neighbours. Algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality.\u0026#91;190\u0026#93;Robotic, mobile laboratory operatorsFurther information: Laboratory roboticsIn July 2020 scientists reported the development of a mobile robot chemist and demonstrate that it can assist in experimental searches. According to the scientists their strategy was automating the researcher rather than the instruments – freeing up time for the human researchers to think creatively – and could identify photocatalyst mixtures for hydrogen production from water that were six times more active than initial formulations. The modular robot can operate laboratory instruments, work nearly around the clock, and autonomously make decisions on his next actions depending on experimental results.\u0026#91;191\u0026#93;\u0026#91;192\u0026#93;Soft-bodied robotsRobots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators (air muscles, electroactive polymers, and ferrofluids) look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons, and can have different behaviors.\u0026#91;193\u0026#93; Soft, flexible (and sometimes even squishy) robots are often designed to mimic the biomechanics of animals and other things found in nature, which is leading to new applications in medicine, care giving, search and rescue, food handling and manufacturing, and scientific exploration.\u0026#91;194\u0026#93;\u0026#91;195\u0026#93;Swarm robotsMain article: Swarm roboticsInspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees, researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism, exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project\u0026#91;196\u0026#93; and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors.\u0026#91;197\u0026#93;\u0026#91;198\u0026#93; Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly.\u0026#91;199\u0026#93;Haptic interface robotsFurther information: Haptic technologyRobotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community. These robots, called \"haptic interfaces\", allow touch-enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments. Robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of \"virtual\" objects, which users can experience through their sense of touch.\u0026#91;200\u0026#93;Contemporary art and sculptureFurther information: Robotic artRobots are used by contemporary artists to create works that include mechanical automation. There are many branches of robotic art, one of which is robotic installation art, a type of installation art that is programmed to respond to viewer interactions, by means of computers, sensors and actuators. The future behavior of such installations can therefore be altered by input from either the artist or the participant, which differentiates these artworks from other types of kinetic art.Le Grand Palais in Paris organized an exhibition \"Artists \u0026amp; Robots\", featuring artworks created by more than forty artists with the help of robots in 2018.\u0026#91;201\u0026#93;Robots in popular cultureToy robots on display at the Museo del Objeto del Objeto in Mexico CitySee also: List of fictional robots and androids and Droid (Star Wars)LiteratureMain article: Robots in literatureRobotic characters, androids (artificial men/women) or gynoids (artificial women), and cyborgs (also \"bionic men/women\", or humans with significant mechanical enhancements) have become a staple of science fiction.The first reference in Western literature to mechanical servants appears in Homer's Iliad. In Book XVIII, Hephaestus, god of fire, creates new armor for the hero Achilles, assisted by robots.\u0026#91;202\u0026#93; According to the Rieu translation, \"Golden maidservants hastened to help their master. They looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods.\" The words \"robot\" or \"android\" are not used to describe them, but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance. \"The first use of the word Robot was in Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (written in 1920)\". Writer Karel Čapek was born in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic).Possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was Isaac Asimov (1920–1992)\u0026#91;203\u0026#93; who published over five-hundred books.\u0026#91;204\u0026#93; Asimov is probably best remembered for his science-fiction stories and especially those about robots, where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works.\u0026#91;205\u0026#93;\u0026#91;206\u0026#93; Asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given to lower the risk to humans, and arrived at his Three Laws of Robotics: a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\u0026#91;207\u0026#93; These were introduced in his 1942 short story \"Runaround\", although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. Later, Asimov added the Zeroth Law: \"A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\"; the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this.According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first passage in Asimov's short story \"Liar!\" (1941) that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics.  Asimov was not initially aware of this; he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics, hydraulics, and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge.\u0026#91;208\u0026#93;Robot competitionsMain article: Robot competitionRobots are used in a number of competitive events. Robot combat competitions have been popularized by television shows such as Robot Wars and BattleBots, featuring mostly remotely controlled 'robots' that compete against each other directly using various weaponry, there are also amateur robot combat leagues active globally outside of the televised events. Micromouse events, in which autonomous robots compete to solve mazes or other obstacle courses are also held internationally.Robot competitions are also often used within educational settings to introduce the concept of robotics to children such as the FIRST Robotics Competition in the US.FilmsSee also: Category:Robot filmsRobots appear in many films. Most of the robots in cinema are fictional. Two of the most famous are R2-D2 and C-3PO from the Star Wars franchise.Sex robotsMain article: Sex robotThe concept of humanoid sex robots has drawn public attention and elicited debate regarding their supposed benefits and potential effects on society. Opponents argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful, and demeaning to women and children,\u0026#91;209\u0026#93; while proponents cite their potential therapeutical benefits, particularly in aiding people with dementia or depression.\u0026#91;210\u0026#93;Problems depicted in popular cultureItalian movie The Mechanical Man (1921), the first film to have shown a battle between robotsFears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films. A common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots, motivated to take over or destroy the human race. Frankenstein (1818), often called the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator.Other works with similar themes include The Mechanical Man, The Terminator, Runaway, RoboCop, the Replicators in Stargate, the Cylons in Battlestar Galactica, the Cybermen and Daleks in Doctor Who, The Matrix, Enthiran and I, Robot. Some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy; others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware. Examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001: A Space Odyssey, Red Planet and Enthiran.The 2017 game Horizon Zero Dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare, robot ethics, and the AI control problem, as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment.Another common theme is the reaction, sometimes called the \"uncanny valley\", of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely.\u0026#91;110\u0026#93;More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.See also.mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul{line-height:inherit;list-style:none;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol li,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul li{margin-bottom:0}Index of robotics articlesOutline of roboticsArtificial intelligenceWilliam Grey WalterSpecific robotics conceptsRobot locomotionSimultaneous localization and mappingTactile sensorTeleoperationUncanny valleyvon Neumann machineWake-up robot problemNeuromorphic engineeringRobotics methods and categoriesCognitive roboticsCompanion robotDomestic robotEpigenetic roboticsEvolutionary roboticsHumanoid robotAutonomous robotSwarm roboticsMicroboticsRobot controlSpecific robots and devicesAIBOAutonomous spaceport drone shipDriverless carFriendly RoboticsLely Juno familyLiquid handling robotParo (robot)PatrolBotRoboBeeRoboriorRobot App StoreOther related articlesAutomated guided vehicleRemote control vehicleRobot AwardRobot economicsUnmanned vehicleTeleoperationFurther reading.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Al-Arshani, Sarah (29 November 2021). \"Researchers behind the world's first living robot have found a way to make it reproduce — by shaping it like Pac-Man\".

agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).\u0026#91;1\u0026#93;The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), because many reinforcement learning algorithms for this context use dynamic programming techniques.\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods  and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process and they target large Markov decision processes where exact methods become infeasible..mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Introduction[edit]The typical framing of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) scenario: an agent takes actions in an environment, which is interpreted into a reward and a representation of the state, which are fed back into the agent.Due to its generality, reinforcement learning is studied in many disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, and statistics. In the operations research and control literature, reinforcement learning is called approximate dynamic programming, or neuro-dynamic programming. The problems of interest in reinforcement learning have also been studied in the theory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithms for their exact computation, and less with learning or approximation, particularly in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment. In economics and game theory, reinforcement learning may be used to explain how equilibrium may arise under bounded rationality.Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as a Markov decision process:a set of environment and agent states, S;a set of actions, A, of the agent;                              P                      a                          (        s        ,                  s          \u0026#x2032;                )        =        Pr        (                  s                      t            +            1                          =                  s          \u0026#x2032;                \u0026#x2223;                  s                      t                          =        s        ,                  a                      t                          =        a        )              {\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')=\\Pr(s_{t+1}=s'\\mid s_{t}=s,a_{t}=a)}  , the probability of transition (at time                     t              {\\displaystyle t}  ) from state                     s              {\\displaystyle s}   to state                               s          \u0026#x2032;                      {\\displaystyle s'}   under action                     a              {\\displaystyle a}  .                              R                      a                          (        s        ,                  s          \u0026#x2032;                )              {\\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}  , the immediate reward after transition from                     s              {\\displaystyle s}   to                               s          \u0026#x2032;                      {\\displaystyle s'}   with action                     a              {\\displaystyle a}  .The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal, or nearly-optimal, policy that maximizes the \"reward function\" or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from the immediate rewards. This is similar to processes that appear to occur in animal psychology. For example, biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. In some circumstances, animals can learn to engage in behaviors that optimize these rewards. This suggests that animals are capable of reinforcement learning.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;\u0026#91;4\u0026#93;A basic reinforcement learning agent AI interacts with its environment in discrete time steps. At each time t, the agent receives the current state                               s                      t                                {\\displaystyle s_{t}}   and reward                               r                      t                                {\\displaystyle r_{t}}  . It then chooses an action                               a                      t                                {\\displaystyle a_{t}}   from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new state                               s                      t            +            1                                {\\displaystyle s_{t+1}}   and the reward                               r                      t            +            1                                {\\displaystyle r_{t+1}}   associated with the transition                     (                  s                      t                          ,                  a                      t                          ,                  s                      t            +            1                          )              {\\displaystyle (s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1})}   is determined. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to learn a policy:                     \u0026#x03C0;        :        A        \u0026#x00D7;        S        \u0026#x2192;        [        0        ,        1        ]              {\\displaystyle \\pi :A\\times S\\rightarrow [0,1]}  ,                     \u0026#x03C0;        (        a        ,        s        )        =        Pr        (                  a                      t                          =        a        \u0026#x2223;                  s                      t                          =        s        )              {\\displaystyle \\pi (a,s)=\\Pr(a_{t}=a\\mid s_{t}=s)}   that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.Formulating the problem as an Markov decision process assumes the agent directly observes the current environmental state; in this case the problem is said to have full observability. If the agent only has access to a subset of states, or if the observed states are corrupted by noise, the agent is said to have partial observability, and formally the problem must be formulated as a Partially observable Markov decision process. In both cases, the set of actions available to the agent can be restricted. For example, the state of an account balance could be restricted to be positive; if the current value of the state is 3 and the state transition attempts to reduce the value by 4, the transition will not be allowed.When the agent's performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally, the difference in performance gives rise to the notion of regret. In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about the long-term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future income), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative.Thus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, including energy storage operation,\u0026#91;5\u0026#93; robot control,\u0026#91;6\u0026#93; elevator scheduling, telecommunications, photovoltaic generators dispatch,\u0026#91;7\u0026#93; backgammon, checkers\u0026#91;8\u0026#93; and Go (AlphaGo).Two elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance and the use of function approximation to deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, reinforcement learning can be used in large environments in the following situations:A model of the environment is known, but an analytic solution is not available;Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject of simulation-based optimization);\u0026#91;9\u0026#93;The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it.The first two of these problems could be considered planning problems (since some form of model is available), while the last one could be considered to be a genuine learning problem. However, reinforcement learning converts both planning problems to machine learning problems.Exploration[edit]The exploration vs. exploitation trade-off has been most thoroughly studied through the multi-armed bandit problem and for finite state space Markov decision processes in Burnetas and Katehakis (1997).\u0026#91;10\u0026#93;Reinforcement learning requires clever exploration mechanisms; randomly selecting actions, without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance. The case of (small) finite Markov decision processes is relatively well understood. However, due to the lack of algorithms that scale well with the number of states (or scale to problems with infinite state spaces), simple exploration methods are the most practical.One such method is                     \u0026#x03B5;              {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }  -greedy, where                     0        \u0026lt;        \u0026#x03B5;        \u0026lt;        1              {\\displaystyle 0\u0026lt;\\varepsilon \u0026lt;1}   is a parameter controlling the amount of exploration vs. exploitation.  With probability                     1        \u0026#x2212;        \u0026#x03B5;              {\\displaystyle 1-\\varepsilon }  , exploitation is chosen, and the agent chooses the action that it believes has the best long-term effect (ties between actions are broken uniformly at random). Alternatively, with probability                     \u0026#x03B5;              {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }  , exploration is chosen, and the action is chosen uniformly at random.                     \u0026#x03B5;              {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }   is usually a fixed parameter but can be adjusted either according to a schedule (making the agent explore progressively less), or adaptively based on heuristics.\u0026#91;11\u0026#93;Algorithms for control learning[edit]Even if the issue of exploration is disregarded and even if the state was observable (assumed hereafter), the problem remains to use past experience to find out which actions lead to higher cumulative rewards.Criterion of optimality[edit]Policy[edit]The agent's action selection is modeled as a map called policy:                    \u0026#x03C0;        :        A        \u0026#x00D7;        S        \u0026#x2192;        [        0        ,        1        ]              {\\displaystyle \\pi :A\\times S\\rightarrow [0,1]}                      \u0026#x03C0;        (        a        ,        s        )        =        Pr        (                  a                      t                          =        a        \u0026#x2223;                  s                      t                          =        s        )              {\\displaystyle \\pi (a,s)=\\Pr(a_{t}=a\\mid s_{t}=s)}  The policy map gives the probability of taking action                     a              {\\displaystyle a}   when in state                     s              {\\displaystyle s}  .\u0026#91;12\u0026#93;\u0026#58;\u0026#8202;61\u0026#8202; There are also deterministic policies.State-value function[edit]The value function                               V                      \u0026#x03C0;                          (        s        )              {\\displaystyle V_{\\pi }(s)}   is defined as, expected return starting with state                     s              {\\displaystyle s}  , i.e.                               s                      0                          =        s              {\\displaystyle s_{0}=s}  , and successively following policy                     \u0026#x03C0;              {\\displaystyle \\pi }  .

Gamma is less than 1, so events in the distant future are weighted less than events in the immediate future.The algorithm must find a policy with maximum expected return. From the theory of Markov decision processes it is known that, without loss of generality, the search can be restricted to the set of so-called stationary policies. A policy is stationary if the action-distribution returned by it depends only on the last state visited (from the observation agent's history). The search can be further restricted to deterministic stationary policies. A deterministic stationary policy deterministically selects actions based on the current state. Since any such policy can be identified with a mapping from the set of states to the set of actions, these policies can be identified with such mappings with no loss of generality.Brute force[edit]The brute force approach entails two steps:For each possible policy, sample returns while following itChoose the policy with the largest expected returnOne problem with this is that the number of policies can be large, or even infinite. Another is that the variance of the returns may be large, which requires many samples to accurately estimate the return of each policy.These problems can be ameliorated if we assume some structure and allow samples generated from one policy to influence the estimates made for others. The two main approaches for achieving this are value function estimation and direct policy search.Value function[edit]See also: Value functionValue function approaches attempt to find a policy that maximizes the return by maintaining a set of estimates of expected returns for some policy (usually either the \"current\" [on-policy] or the optimal [off-policy] one).These methods rely on the theory of Markov decision processes, where optimality is defined in a sense that is stronger than the above one: A policy is called optimal if it achieves the best-expected return from any initial state (i.e., initial distributions play no role in this definition). Again, an optimal policy can always be found amongst stationary policies.To define optimality in a formal manner, define the value of a policy                     \u0026#x03C0;              {\\displaystyle \\pi }   by                              V                      \u0026#x03C0;                          (        s        )        =        E        [        R        \u0026#x2223;        s        ,        \u0026#x03C0;        ]        ,              {\\displaystyle V^{\\pi }(s)=E[R\\mid s,\\pi ],}  where                     R              {\\displaystyle R}   stands for the return associated with following                     \u0026#x03C0;              {\\displaystyle \\pi }   from the initial state                     s              {\\displaystyle s}  .

The action-value function of such an optimal policy (                              Q                                    \u0026#x03C0;                              \u0026#x2217;                                                          {\\displaystyle Q^{\\pi ^{*}}}  ) is called the optimal action-value function and is commonly denoted by                               Q                      \u0026#x2217;                                {\\displaystyle Q^{*}}  . In summary, the knowledge of the optimal action-value function alone suffices to know how to act optimally.Assuming full knowledge of the Markov decision process, the two basic approaches to compute the optimal action-value function are value iteration and policy iteration. Both algorithms compute a sequence of functions                               Q                      k                                {\\displaystyle Q_{k}}   (                    k        =        0        ,        1        ,        2        ,        \u0026#x2026;              {\\displaystyle k=0,1,2,\\ldots }  ) that converge to                               Q                      \u0026#x2217;                                {\\displaystyle Q^{*}}  . Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) Markov decision processes. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces.Monte Carlo methods[edit]Monte Carlo methods can be used in an algorithm that mimics policy iteration. Policy iteration consists of two steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement.Monte Carlo is used in the policy evaluation step. In this step, given a stationary, deterministic policy                     \u0026#x03C0;              {\\displaystyle \\pi }  , the goal is to compute the function values                               Q                      \u0026#x03C0;                          (        s        ,        a        )              {\\displaystyle Q^{\\pi }(s,a)}   (or a good approximation to them) for all state-action pairs                     (        s        ,        a        )              {\\displaystyle (s,a)}  . Assume (for simplicity) that the Markov decision process is finite, that sufficient memory is available to accommodate the action-values and that the problem is episodic and after each episode a new one starts from some random initial state. Then, the estimate of the value of a given state-action pair                     (        s        ,        a        )              {\\displaystyle (s,a)}   can be computed by averaging the sampled returns that originated from                     (        s        ,        a        )              {\\displaystyle (s,a)}   over time.  Given sufficient time, this procedure can thus construct a precise estimate                     Q              {\\displaystyle Q}   of the action-value function                               Q                      \u0026#x03C0;                                {\\displaystyle Q^{\\pi }}  . This finishes the description of the policy evaluation step.In the policy improvement step, the next policy is obtained by computing a greedy policy with respect to                     Q              {\\displaystyle Q}  : Given a state                     s              {\\displaystyle s}  , this new policy returns an action that maximizes                     Q        (        s        ,        \u0026#x22C5;        )              {\\displaystyle Q(s,\\cdot )}  . In practice lazy evaluation can defer the computation of the maximizing actions to when they are needed.Problems with this procedure include:1. The procedure may spend too much time evaluating a suboptimal policy.2. It uses samples inefficiently in that a long trajectory improves the estimate only of the single state-action pair that started the trajectory.3. When the returns along the trajectories have high variance, convergence is slow.4. It works in episodic problems only.5. It works in small, finite Markov decision processes only.Temporal difference methods[edit]Main article: Temporal difference learningThe first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class of generalized policy iteration algorithms. Many actor-critic methods belong to this category.The second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third problem, although a better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton's temporal difference (TD) methods that are based on the recursive Bellman equation.\u0026#91;13\u0026#93;\u0026#91;14\u0026#93; The computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method,\u0026#91;15\u0026#93; may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue.Another problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation. Most TD methods have a so-called                     \u0026#x03BB;              {\\displaystyle \\lambda }   parameter                     (        0        \u0026#x2264;        \u0026#x03BB;        \u0026#x2264;        1        )              {\\displaystyle (0\\leq \\lambda \\leq 1)}   that can continuously interpolate between Monte Carlo methods that do not rely on the Bellman equations and the basic TD methods that rely entirely on the Bellman equations. This can be effective in palliating this issue.Function approximation methods[edit]In order to address the fifth issue, function approximation methods are used. Linear function approximation starts with a mapping                     \u0026#x03D5;              {\\displaystyle \\phi }   that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair                     (        s        ,        a        )              {\\displaystyle (s,a)}   are obtained by linearly combining the components of                     \u0026#x03D5;        (        s        ,        a        )              {\\displaystyle \\phi (s,a)}   with some weights                     \u0026#x03B8;              {\\displaystyle \\theta }  :                    Q        (        s        ,        a        )        =                  \u0026#x2211;                      i            =            1                                d                                    \u0026#x03B8;                      i                                    \u0026#x03D5;                      i                          (        s        ,        a        )        .              {\\displaystyle Q(s,a)=\\sum _{i=1}^{d}\\theta _{i}\\phi _{i}(s,a).}  The algorithms then adjust the weights, instead of adjusting the values associated with the individual state-action pairs. Methods based on ideas from nonparametric statistics (which can be seen to construct their own features) have been explored.Value iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to the Q-learning algorithm and its many variants.\u0026#91;16\u0026#93; Including Deep Q-learning methods when a neural network is used to represent Q, with various applications in stochastic search problems.\u0026#91;17\u0026#93;The problem with using action-values is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy, though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods. Using the so-called compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency.Direct policy search[edit]An alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case of stochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods.Gradient-based methods (policy gradient methods) start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vector                     \u0026#x03B8;              {\\displaystyle \\theta }  , let                               \u0026#x03C0;                      \u0026#x03B8;                                {\\displaystyle \\pi _{\\theta }}   denote the policy associated to                     \u0026#x03B8;              {\\displaystyle \\theta }  . Defining the performance function by                    \u0026#x03C1;        (        \u0026#x03B8;        )        =                  \u0026#x03C1;                                    \u0026#x03C0;                              \u0026#x03B8;                                                    ,              {\\displaystyle \\rho (\\theta )=\\rho ^{\\pi _{\\theta }},}  under mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vector                     \u0026#x03B8;              {\\displaystyle \\theta }  . If the gradient of                     \u0026#x03C1;              {\\displaystyle \\rho }   was known, one could use gradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams' REINFORCE method\u0026#91;18\u0026#93; (which is known as the likelihood ratio method in the simulation-based optimization literature).\u0026#91;19\u0026#93; Policy search methods have been used in the robotics context.\u0026#91;20\u0026#93; Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based on local search).A large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These include simulated annealing, cross-entropy search or methods of evolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum.Policy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years, actor–critic methods have been proposed and performed well on various problems.\u0026#91;21\u0026#93;Model-based algorithms[edit]Finally, all of the above methods can be combined with algorithms that first learn a model.  For instance, the Dyna algorithm\u0026#91;22\u0026#93; learns a model from experience, and uses that to provide more modelled transitions for a value function, in addition to the real transitions.  Such methods can sometimes be extended to use of non-parametric models, such as when the transitions are simply stored and 'replayed'\u0026#91;23\u0026#93; to the learning algorithm.There are other ways to use models than to update a value function.\u0026#91;24\u0026#93; For instance, in model predictive control the model is used to update the behavior directly.Theory[edit]Both the asymptotic and finite-sample behaviors of most algorithms are well understood. Algorithms with provably good online performance (addressing the exploration issue) are known.Efficient exploration of Markov decision processes is given in  Burnetas and Katehakis (1997).\u0026#91;10\u0026#93; Finite-time performance bounds have also appeared for many algorithms, but these bounds are expected to be rather loose and thus more work is needed to better understand the relative advantages and limitations.For incremental algorithms, asymptotic convergence issues have been settled\u0026#91;clarification needed\u0026#93;.

In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.\u0026#91;38\u0026#93;Deep reinforcement learning[edit]This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.\u0026#91;39\u0026#93; The work on learning ATARI games by Google DeepMind increased attention to deep reinforcement learning or end-to-end reinforcement learning.\u0026#91;40\u0026#93;Adversarial deep reinforcement learning[edit]Adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies. In this research area some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations.\u0026#91;41\u0026#93;\u0026#91;42\u0026#93;\u0026#91;43\u0026#93; While some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities, in the most recent studies it has been shown that these proposed solutions are far from providing an accurate representation of current vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies.\u0026#91;44\u0026#93;Fuzzy reinforcement learning[edit]By introducing fuzzy inference in reinforcement learning,\u0026#91;45\u0026#93; approximating the state-action value function with fuzzy rules in continuous space becomes possible. The IF - THEN form of fuzzy rules make this approach suitable for expressing the results in a form close to natural language. Extending FRL with Fuzzy Rule Interpolation \u0026#91;46\u0026#93; allows the use of reduced size sparse fuzzy rule-bases to emphasize cardinal rules (most important state-action values).Inverse reinforcement learning[edit]In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), no reward function is given. Instead, the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert. The idea is to mimic observed behavior, which is often optimal or close to optimal.\u0026#91;47\u0026#93;Safe reinforcement learning[edit]Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes.\u0026#91;48\u0026#93;See also[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul{line-height:inherit;list-style:none;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol li,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul li{margin-bottom:0}Temporal difference learningQ-learningState–action–reward–state–action (SARSA)Reinforcement learning from human feedbackFictitious playLearning classifier systemOptimal controlDynamic treatment regimesError-driven learningMulti-agent reinforcement learningMulti-agent systemDistributed artificial intelligenceIntrinsic motivationGenetic algorithmsApprenticeship learningModel-free (reinforcement learning)References[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Kaelbling, Leslie P.; Littman, Michael L.; Moore, Andrew W.

systemLinux, macOS (experimental), Windows 10 (experimental)TypeRobotics suite, OS, libraryLicenseApache 2.0Websitewww.ros.orgAs ofJune 2023Robot Operating System (ROS or ros) is an open-source robotics middleware suite. Although ROS is not an operating system (OS) but a set of software frameworks for robot software  development, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. Running sets of ROS-based processes are represented in a graph architecture where processing takes place in nodes that may receive, post, and multiplex sensor data, control, state, planning, actuator, and other messages. Despite the importance of reactivity and low latency in robot control, ROS is not a real-time operating system (RTOS). However, it is possible to integrate ROS with real-time computing code.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; The lack of support for real-time systems has been addressed in the creation of ROS 2,\u0026#91;4\u0026#93;\u0026#91;5\u0026#93;\u0026#91;6\u0026#93; a major revision of the ROS API which will take advantage of modern libraries and technologies for core ROS functions and add support for real-time code and embedded system hardware.Software in the ROS Ecosystem\u0026#91;7\u0026#93; can be separated into three groups:language-and platform-independent tools used for building and distributing ROS-based software;ROS client library implementations such as roscpp,\u0026#91;8\u0026#93; rospy,\u0026#91;9\u0026#93; and roslisp;\u0026#91;10\u0026#93;packages containing application-related code which uses one or more ROS client libraries.\u0026#91;11\u0026#93;Both the language-independent tools and the main client libraries (C++, Python, and Lisp) are released under the terms of the BSD license, and as such are open-source software and free for both commercial and research use. The majority of other packages are licensed under a variety of open-source licenses. These other packages implement commonly used functionality and applications such as hardware drivers, robot models, datatypes, planning, perception, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), simulation tools, and other algorithms.The main ROS client libraries are geared toward a Unix-like system, mostly because of their dependence on large sets of open-source software dependencies. For these client libraries, Ubuntu Linux is listed as \"Supported\" while other variants such as Fedora Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows are designated \"experimental\" and are supported by the community.\u0026#91;12\u0026#93; The native Java ROS client library, rosjava,\u0026#91;13\u0026#93; however, does not share these limitations and has enabled ROS-based software to be written for the Android OS.\u0026#91;14\u0026#93; rosjava has also enabled ROS to be integrated into an officially supported MATLAB toolbox which can be used on Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.\u0026#91;15\u0026#93; A JavaScript client library, roslibjs\u0026#91;16\u0026#93; has also been developed which enables integration of software into a ROS system via any standards-compliant web browser.History[edit]Early days at Stanford (2007 and earlier)[edit]Sometime before 2007, the first pieces of what eventually would become ROS began coalescing at Stanford University.\u0026#91;17\u0026#93;\u0026#91;18\u0026#93; Eric Berger and Keenan Wyrobek, PhD students working in Kenneth Salisbury's\u0026#91;19\u0026#93; robotics laboratory at Stanford, were leading the Personal Robotics Program.\u0026#91;20\u0026#93; While working on robots to do manipulation tasks in human environments, the two students noticed that many of their colleagues were held back by the diverse nature of robotics: an excellent software developer might not have the hardware knowledge required, someone developing state of the art path planning might not know how to do the computer vision required. In an attempt to remedy this situation, the two students set out to make a baseline system that would provide a starting place for others in academia to build upon. In the words of Eric Berger, \"something that didn’t suck, in all of those different dimensions\".\u0026#91;17\u0026#93;In their first steps towards this unifying system, the two built the PR1 as a hardware prototype and began to work on software from it, borrowing the best practices from other early open-source robotic software frameworks, particularly switchyard, a system that Morgan Quigley, another Stanford PhD student, had been working on in support of the STanford Artificial Intelligence Robot (STAIR)\u0026#91;21\u0026#93;\u0026#91;22\u0026#93;\u0026#91;23\u0026#93;\u0026#91;24\u0026#93; by the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Early funding of US$50,000 was provided by Joanna Hoffman and Alain Rossmann, which supported the development of the PR1. While seeking funding for further development,\u0026#91;25\u0026#93; Eric Berger and Keenan Wyrobek met Scott Hassan, the founder of Willow Garage, a technology incubator which was working on an autonomous SUV and a solar autonomous boat. Hassan shared Berger and Wyrobek's vision of a \"Linux for robotics\", and invited them to come and work at Willow Garage. Willow Garage was started in January 2007, and the first commit of ROS code was made to SourceForge on 7 November 2007.\u0026#91;26\u0026#93;Willow Garage (2007–2013)[edit]Willow Garage began developing the PR2 robot as a follow-up to the PR1, and ROS as the software to run it. Groups from more than twenty institutions made contributions to ROS, both the core software and the growing number of packages which worked with ROS to form a greater software ecosystem.\u0026#91;27\u0026#93;\u0026#91;28\u0026#93; That people outside of Willow were contributing to ROS (especially from Stanford's STAIR project) meant that ROS was a multi-robot platform from the start. While Willow Garage had originally had other projects in progress, they were scrapped in favor of the Personal Robotics Program: focused on producing the PR2 as a research platform for academia and ROS as the open-source robotics stack that would underlie both academic research and tech startups, much like the LAMP stack did for web-based startups.In December 2008, Willow Garage met the first of their three internal milestones: continuous navigation for the PR2 over a period of two days and a distance of pi kilometers.\u0026#91;29\u0026#93; Soon after, an early version of ROS (0.4 Mango Tango)\u0026#91;30\u0026#93; was released, followed by the first RVIZ documentation and the first paper on ROS.\u0026#91;28\u0026#93; In early summer, the second internal milestone: having the PR2 navigate the office, open doors, and plug itself it in, was reached.\u0026#91;31\u0026#93; This was followed in August by the initiation of the ROS.org website.\u0026#91;32\u0026#93; Early tutorials on ROS were posted in December,\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; preparing for the release of ROS 1.0, in January 2010.\u0026#91;34\u0026#93; This was Milestone 3: producing tons of documentation and tutorials for the enormous abilities that Willow Garage's engineers had developed over the preceding 3 years.Following this, Willow Garage achieved one of its longest held goals: giving away 10 PR2 robots to worthy academic institutions. This had long been a goal of the founders, as they felt that the PR2 could kick-start robotics research around the world. They ended up awarding eleven PR2s to different institutions, including University of Freiburg (Germany), Robert Bosch GmbH, Georgia Institute of Technology, KU Leuven (Belgium), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University, Technical University of Munich (Germany), University of California, Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California (USC), and University of Tokyo (Japan).\u0026#91;35\u0026#93; This, combined with Willow Garage's highly successful internship program\u0026#91;36\u0026#93; (run from 2008 to 2010 by Melonee Wise), helped to spread the word about ROS throughout the robotics world. The first official ROS distribution release: ROS Box Turtle, was released on 2 March 2010, marking the first time that ROS was officially distributed with a set of versioned packages for public use. These developments led to the first drone running ROS,\u0026#91;37\u0026#93; the first autonomous car running ROS,\u0026#91;38\u0026#93; and the adaption of ROS for Lego Mindstorms.\u0026#91;39\u0026#93; With the PR2 Beta program well underway, the PR2 robot was officially released for commercial purchase on 9 September 2010.\u0026#91;40\u0026#93;An image of Robot Operating System (ROS) running in Antarctica.2011 was a banner year for ROS with the launch of ROS Answers, a Q/A forum for ROS users, on 15 February;\u0026#91;41\u0026#93; the introduction of the highly successful TurtleBot robot kit on 18 April;\u0026#91;42\u0026#93; and the total number of ROS repositories passing 100 on 5 May.\u0026#91;43\u0026#93; Willow Garage began 2012 by creating the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)\u0026#91;44\u0026#93; in April. The OSRF was immediately awarded a software contract by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\u0026#91;45\u0026#93; Later that year, the first ROSCon was held in St. Paul, Minnesota,\u0026#91;46\u0026#93; the first book on ROS, ROS By Example,\u0026#91;47\u0026#93; was published, and Baxter, the first commercial robot to run ROS, was announced by Rethink Robotics.\u0026#91;48\u0026#93; Soon after passing its fifth anniversary in November, ROS began running on every continent on 3 December 2012.\u0026#91;49\u0026#93;In February 2013, the OSRF became the primary software maintainers for ROS,\u0026#91;50\u0026#93; foreshadowing the announcement in August that Willow Garage would be absorbed by its founders, Suitable Technologies.\u0026#91;51\u0026#93; At this point, ROS had released seven major versions (up to ROS Groovy),\u0026#91;52\u0026#93; and had users all over the globe. This chapter of ROS development would be finalized when Clearpath Robotics took over support responsibilities for the PR2 in early 2014.\u0026#91;53\u0026#93;OSRF and Open Robotics (2013–present)[edit]In the years since OSRF took over primary development of ROS, a new version has been released every year,\u0026#91;52\u0026#93; while interest in ROS continues to grow. ROSCons have occurred every year since 2012, co-located with either ICRA or IROS, two flagship robotics conferences. Meetups of ROS developers have been organized in a variety of countries,\u0026#91;54\u0026#93;\u0026#91;55\u0026#93;\u0026#91;56\u0026#93; a number of ROS books have been published,\u0026#91;57\u0026#93; and many educational programs initiated.\u0026#91;58\u0026#93;\u0026#91;59\u0026#93; On 1 September 2014, NASA announced the first robot to run ROS in space: Robotnaut 2, on the International Space Station.\u0026#91;60\u0026#93; In 2017, the OSRF changed its name to Open Robotics. Tech giants Amazon and Microsoft began to take an interest in ROS during this time, with Microsoft porting core ROS to Windows in September 2018,\u0026#91;61\u0026#93; followed by Amazon Web Services releasing RoboMaker in November 2018.\u0026#91;62\u0026#93;Perhaps the most important development of the OSRF/Open Robotics years thus far (not to discount the explosion of robot platforms which began to support ROS or the enormous improvements in each ROS version) was the proposal of ROS 2, a significant API change to ROS which is intended to support real-time programming, a wider variety of computing environments, and more modern technology.\u0026#91;63\u0026#93; ROS 2 was announced at ROSCon 2014,\u0026#91;64\u0026#93; the first commits to the ros2 repository were made in February 2015, followed by alpha releases in August 2015.\u0026#91;65\u0026#93; The first distribution release of ROS 2, Ardent Apalone, was released on 8 December 2017,\u0026#91;65\u0026#93; ushering in a new era of next-generation ROS development.Design[edit]Philosophy[edit]An image depicting the ROS equation: Plumbing + Tools + Capabilities + Ecosystem = ROS!ROS was designed to be open source, intending that users would be able to choose the configuration of tools and libraries which interacted with the core of ROS so that users could shift their software stacks to fit their robot and application area. As such, there is very little which is core to ROS, beyond the general structure within which programs must exist and communicate. In one sense, ROS is the underlying plumbing behind nodes and message passing. However, in reality, ROS is not only that plumbing, but a rich and mature set of tools, a wide-ranging set of robot-agnostic abilities provided by packages, and a greater ecosystem of additions to ROS.Computation graph model[edit]ROS processes are represented as nodes in a graph structure, connected by edges called topics.\u0026#91;66\u0026#93; ROS nodes can pass messages to one another through topics, make service calls to other nodes, provide a service for other nodes, or set or retrieve shared data from a communal database called the parameter server. A process called the ROS Master\u0026#91;66\u0026#93; makes all of this possible by registering nodes to itself, setting up node-to-node communication for topics, and controlling parameter server updates. Messages and service calls do not pass through the master, rather the master sets up peer-to-peer communication between all node processes after they register themselves with the master. This decentralized architecture lends itself well to robots, which often consist of a subset of networked computer hardware, and may communicate with off-board computers for heavy computing or commands.Nodes[edit]A node represents one process running the ROS graph. Every node has a name, which it registers with the ROS master before it can take any other actions. Multiple nodes with different names can exist under different namespaces, or a node can be defined as anonymous, in which case it will randomly generate an additional identifier to add to its given name. Nodes are at the center of ROS programming, as most ROS client code is in the form of a ROS node which takes actions based on information received from other nodes, sends information to other nodes, or sends and receives requests for actions to and from other nodes.Topics[edit]Topics are named buses over which nodes send and receive messages.\u0026#91;67\u0026#93; Topic names must be unique within their namespace as well. To send messages to a topic, a node must publish to said topic, while to receive messages it must subscribe. The publish/subscribe model is anonymous: no node knows which nodes are sending or receiving on a topic, only that it is sending/receiving on that topic. The types of messages passed on a topic vary widely and can be user-defined. The content of these messages can be sensor data, motor control commands, state information, actuator commands, or anything else.Services[edit]A node may also advertise services.\u0026#91;68\u0026#93; A service represents an action that a node can take which will have a single result. As such, services are often used for actions which have a defined start and end, such as capturing a one-frame image, rather than processing velocity commands to a wheel motor or odometer data from a wheel encoder. Nodes advertise services and call services from one another.Parameter server[edit]The parameter server\u0026#91;68\u0026#93; is a database shared between nodes which allows for communal access to static or semi-static information. Data which does not change frequently and as such will be infrequently accessed, such as the distance between two fixed points in the environment, or the weight of the robot, are good candidates for storage in the parameter server.Tools[edit]ROS's core functionality is augmented by a variety of tools which allow developers to visualize and record data, easily navigate the ROS package structures, and create scripts automating complex configuration and setup processes. The addition of these tools greatly increases the abilities of systems using ROS by simplifying and providing solutions to a number of common robotics development problems. These tools are provided in packages like any other algorithm, but rather than providing implementations of hardware drivers or algorithms for various robotic tasks, these packages provide task and robot-agnostic tools which come with the core of most modern ROS installations.rviz[edit]rviz\u0026#91;69\u0026#93; (Robot Visualization tool) is a three-dimensional visualizer used to visualize robots, the environments they work in, and sensor data. It is a highly configurable tool, with many different types of visualizations and plugins. Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML file format for robot model description.rosbag[edit]rosbag\u0026#91;70\u0026#93; is a command line tool used to record and playback ROS message data. rosbag uses a file format called bags,\u0026#91;71\u0026#93; which log ROS messages by listening to topics and recording messages as they come in. Playing messages back from a bag is largely the same as having the original nodes which produced the data in the ROS computation graph, making bags a useful tool for recording data to be used in later development. While rosbag is a command line only tool, rqt_bag\u0026#91;72\u0026#93; provides a GUI interface to rosbag.catkin[edit]catkin\u0026#91;73\u0026#93; is the ROS build system, having replaced rosbuild\u0026#91;74\u0026#93; as of ROS Groovy. catkin is based on CMake, and is similarly cross-platform, open-source, and language-independent.rosbash[edit]The rosbash\u0026#91;75\u0026#93; package provides a suite of tools which augment the functionality of the bash shell. These tools include rosls, roscd, and roscp, which replicate the functionalities of ls, cd, and cp respectively. The ROS versions of these tools allow users to use ros package names in place of the file path where the package is located. The package also adds tab-completion to most ROS utilities, and includes rosed, which edits a given file with the chosen default text editor, as well rosrun, which runs executables in ROS packages. rosbash supports the same functionalities for zsh and tcsh, to a lesser extent.roslaunch[edit]roslaunch\u0026#91;76\u0026#93; is a tool used to launch multiple ROS nodes both locally and remotely, as well as setting parameters on the ROS parameter server. roslaunch configuration files, which are written using XML can easily automate a complex startup and configuration process into a single command. roslaunch scripts can include other roslaunch scripts, launch nodes on specific machines, and even restart processes which die during execution.Packages of note[edit]ROS contains many open-source implementations of common robotics functionality and algorithms. These open-source implementations are organized into packages. Many packages are included as part of ROS distributions, while others may be developed by individuals and distributed through code sharing sites such as github. Some packages of note include:Systems and tools[edit]actionlib\u0026#91;77\u0026#93; provides a standardized interface for interfacing with preemptable tasks.nodelet\u0026#91;78\u0026#93; provides a way to run multiple algorithms in a single process.rosbridge\u0026#91;79\u0026#93; provides a JSON API to ROS functionalities for non-ROS programs.Mapping and localization[edit]slam toolbox\u0026#91;80\u0026#93; provides full 2D SLAM and localization system.gmapping\u0026#91;81\u0026#93; provides a wrapper for OpenSlam's Gmapping algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping.cartographer\u0026#91;82\u0026#93; provides real time 2D and 3D SLAM algorithms developed at Google.amcl\u0026#91;83\u0026#93; provides an implementation of adaptive Monte-Carlo localization.Navigation[edit]navigation\u0026#91;84\u0026#93; provides the capability of navigating a mobile robot in a planar environment.Manipulation[edit]MoveIt!\u0026#91;85\u0026#93; provides motion planning capabilities for robot manipulators. Its default planning library is the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL).\u0026#91;86\u0026#93;Perception[edit]vision_opencv\u0026#91;87\u0026#93; is a meta-package which provides packages for integrating ROS with OpenCV.Coordinate frame representation[edit]tf\u0026#91;88\u0026#93; provided a system for representing, tracking and transforming coordinate frames until ROS Hydro, when it was deprecated in favor of tf2.tf2\u0026#91;89\u0026#93; is the second generation of the tf library, and provides the same abilities for ROS versions after Hydro.Simulation[edit]gazebo_ros_pkgs\u0026#91;90\u0026#93; is a meta-package which provides packages for integrating ROS with the Gazebo simulator.stage\u0026#91;91\u0026#93; provides an interface for the 2D Stage simulator.Versions and releases[edit]ROS releases may be incompatible with other releases and are often referred to by code name rather than version number. ROS currently releases a version every year in May, following the release of Ubuntu LTS versions.\u0026#91;92\u0026#93; ROS 2 currently releases a new version every six months (in December and July). These releases are supported for a single year. There are currently two active major versions seeing releases: ROS 1 and ROS 2. Aside to this there is the ROS-Industrial or ROS-I derivate project since at least 2012.ROS 1[edit]ROS 1 Distribution Releases\u0026#91;52\u0026#93;DistributionRelease datePosterEOL dateSupport durationNoetic Ninjemys(last ROS 1 release)23 May 2020Current stable version: May 20255 yearsMelodic Morenia23 May 2018Old version, no longer maintained: 2023-05-305 yearsLunar Loggerhead23 May 2017Old version, no longer maintained: 2019-05-302 yearsKinetic Kame23 May 2016Old version, no longer maintained: 2021-05-305 yearsJade Turtle23 May 2015Old version, no longer maintained: 2017-05-302 yearsIndigo Igloo22 July 2014Old version, no longer maintained: 2019-04-305 yearsHydro Medusa4 September 2013Old version, no longer maintained: 2014-05-310.5 yearsGroovy Galapagos31 December 2012Old version, no longer maintained: 2014-07-312 yearsFuerte Turtle23 April 2012Old version, no longer maintained: --Electric Emys30 August 2011Old version, no longer maintained: --Diamondback2 March 2011Old version, no longer maintained: --C Turtle2 August 2010Old version, no longer maintained: --Box Turtle2 March 2010Old version, no longer maintained: --(Initial Release)2007n/aOld version, no longer maintained: --n/aLegend:Old versionOlder version, still maintainedLatest versionLatest preview versionFuture releaseROS 2[edit]ROS 2 Distribution Releases\u0026#91;65\u0026#93;\u0026#91;93\u0026#93;DistributionRelease datePosterEOL dateSupport durationRolling Ridley\u0026#91;94\u0026#93;\u0026#91;95\u0026#93;(rolling release with latest features)progressing sinceJune 2020N/AN/AJazzy Jalisco\u0026#91;2\u0026#93;May 2024t.b.d.Future release: EST.

In the industrial environment, there are two different approaches to programming a robot: either through an external proprietary controller, typically implemented using ROS, or via the respective native programming language of the robot. ROS can therefore be seen as the software-based approach to program industrial robots instead of the classic robot controller-based approach.\u0026#91;108\u0026#93;The ROS-Industrial repository includes interfaces for common industrial manipulators, grippers, sensors, and device networks. It also provides software libraries for automatic 2D/3D sensor calibration, process path/motion planning, applications like Scan-N-Plan, developer tools like the Qt Creator ROS Plugin, and training curriculum that is specific to the needs of manufacturers. ROS-I is supported by an international Consortium of industry and research members. The project began as a collaborative endeavor between Yaskawa Motoman Robotics, Southwest Research Institute, and Willow Garage to support the use of ROS for manufacturing automation, with the GitHub repository being founded in January 2012 by Shaun Edwards (SwRI). Currently, the Consortium is divided into three groups; the ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas (led by SwRI and located in San Antonio, Texas), the ROS-Industrial Consortium Europe (led by Fraunhofer IPA and located in Stuttgart, Germany) and the ROS-Industrial Consortium Asia Pacific (led by Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and located in Singapore).The Consortia supports the global ROS-Industrial community by conducting ROS-I training, providing technical support and setting the future roadmap for ROS-I, as well as conducting precompetitive joint industry projects to develop new ROS-I abilities.\u0026#91;109\u0026#93;ROS-compatible robots and hardware[edit]Robots[edit]ABB, Adept, Fanuc, Motoman, and Universal Robots are supported by ROS-Industrial.\u0026#91;110\u0026#93;Baxter\u0026#91;111\u0026#93;

.hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}For the term in intelligent design, see Intelligent designer.In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent (IA) is an agent acting in an intelligent manner; It perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or acquiring knowledge. An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: A thermostat or other control system is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\u0026#91;1\u0026#93;Simple reflex agent diagramLeading AI textbooks define \"artificial intelligence\" as the \"study and design of intelligent agents\", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, \"rational agent\".\u0026#91;1\u0026#93;An agent has an \"objective function\" that encapsulates all the IA's goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function.\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a \"reward function\" that allows the programmers to shape the IA's desired behavior,\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; and an evolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a \"fitness function\".\u0026#91;4\u0026#93; Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations. Intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users).As a definition of artificial intelligence[edit]Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\u0026#91;5\u0026#93;\u0026#91;6\u0026#93;\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; defines an \"agent\" as \"Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators\"It defines a \"rational agent\" as:\"An agent that acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge.\"It also defines the field of \"artificial intelligence research\" as:\"The study and design of rational agents\"Padgham \u0026amp; Winikoff (2005) agree that an intelligent agent is situated in an environment and responds in a timely (though not necessarily real-time) manner to changes in the environment. However, intelligent agents must also proactively pursue goals in a flexible and robust way.\u0026#91;a\u0026#93; Optional desiderata include that the agent be rational, and that the agent be capable of belief-desire-intention analysis.\u0026#91;7\u0026#93;Kaplan and Haenlein define artificial intelligence as \"A system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.\"\u0026#91;8\u0026#93; This definition is closely related to that of an intelligent agent.Advantages[edit].mw-parser-output .ambox{border:1px solid #a2a9b1;border-left:10px solid #36c;background-color:#fbfbfb;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+link+.ambox{margin-top:-1px}html body.mediawiki .mw-parser-output .ambox.mbox-small-left{margin:4px 1em 4px 0;overflow:hidden;width:238px;border-collapse:collapse;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em}.mw-parser-output .ambox-speedy{border-left:10px solid #b32424;background-color:#fee7e6}.mw-parser-output .ambox-delete{border-left:10px solid #b32424}.mw-parser-output .ambox-content{border-left:10px solid #f28500}.mw-parser-output .ambox-style{border-left:10px solid #fc3}.mw-parser-output .ambox-move{border-left:10px solid #9932cc}.mw-parser-output .ambox-protection{border-left:10px solid #a2a9b1}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-text{border:none;padding:0.25em 0.5em;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image{border:none;padding:2px 0 2px 0.5em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-imageright{border:none;padding:2px 0.5em 2px 0;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-empty-cell{border:none;padding:0;width:1px}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image-div{width:52px}html.client-js body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .mbox-text-span{margin-left:23px!important}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .ambox{margin:0 10%}}This section possibly contains original research.

Statements consisting only of original research should be removed.  (February 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Philosophically, this definition of artificial intelligence avoids several lines of criticism. Unlike the Turing test, it does not refer to human intelligence in any way. Thus, there is no need to discuss if it is \"real\" vs \"simulated\" intelligence (i.e., \"synthetic\" vs \"artificial\" intelligence) and does not indicate that such a machine has a mind, consciousness or true understanding (i.e., it does not imply John Searle's \"strong AI hypothesis\"). It also doesn't attempt to draw a sharp dividing line between behaviors that are \"intelligent\" and behaviors that are \"unintelligent\"—programs need only be measured in terms of their objective function.More importantly, it has a number of practical advantages that have helped move AI research forward. It provides a reliable and scientific way to test programs; researchers can directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\".  It also gives them a common language to communicate with other fields—such as mathematical optimization (which is defined in terms of \"goals\") or economics (which uses the same definition of a \"rational agent\").\u0026#91;9\u0026#93;Objective function[edit]Further information: utility function (economics)\u0026#32;and loss function (mathematics)An agent that is assigned an explicit \"goal function\" is considered more intelligent if it consistently takes actions that successfully maximize its programmed goal function. The goal can be simple (\"1 if the IA wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise\") or complex (\"Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past\"). The \"goal function\" encapsulates all of the goals the agent is driven to act on; in the case of rational agents, the function also encapsulates the acceptable trade-offs between accomplishing conflicting goals. (Terminology varies; for example, some agents seek to maximize or minimize a \"utility function\", \"objective function\", or \"loss function\".)\u0026#91;6\u0026#93;\u0026#91;2\u0026#93;Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", it has a \"reward function\" that encourages some types of behavior and punishes others. Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.\u0026#91;10\u0026#93; Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.\u0026#91;11\u0026#93; Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to accomplish its narrow classification task.\u0026#91;12\u0026#93;Systems that are not traditionally considered agents, such as knowledge-representation systems, are sometimes subsumed into the paradigm by framing them as agents that have a goal of (for example) answering questions as accurately as possible; the concept of an \"action\" is here extended to encompass the \"act\" of giving an answer to a question. As an additional extension, mimicry-driven systems can be framed as agents who are optimizing a \"goal function\" based on how closely the IA succeeds in mimicking the desired behavior.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93;\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; In the generative adversarial networks of the 2010s, an \"encoder\"/\"generator\" component attempts to mimic and improvise human text composition. The generator is attempting to maximize a function encapsulating how well it can fool an antagonistic \"predictor\"/\"discriminator\" component.\u0026#91;13\u0026#93;While symbolic AI systems often accept an explicit goal function, the paradigm can also be applied to neural networks and to evolutionary computing. Reinforcement learning can generate intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a \"reward function\".\u0026#91;14\u0026#93; Sometimes, rather than setting the reward function to be directly equal to the desired benchmark evaluation function, machine learning programmers will use reward shaping to initially give the machine rewards for incremental progress in learning.\u0026#91;15\u0026#93; Yann LeCun stated in 2018 that \"Most of the learning algorithms that people have come up with essentially consist of minimizing some objective function.\"\u0026#91;16\u0026#93; AlphaZero chess had a simple objective function; each win counted as +1 point, and each loss counted as -1 point. An objective function for a self-driving car would have to be more complicated.\u0026#91;17\u0026#93; Evolutionary computing can evolve intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a \"fitness function\" that influences how many descendants each agent is allowed to leave.\u0026#91;4\u0026#93;The theoretical and uncomputable AIXI design is a maximally intelligent agent in this paradigm;\u0026#91;18\u0026#93; however, in the real world, the IA is constrained by finite time and hardware resources, and scientists compete to produce algorithms that can achieve progressively higher scores on benchmark tests with real-world hardware.\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;\u0026#91;relevant?\u0026#93;Classes of intelligent agents[edit]Russel and Norvig's classification[edit]Russell \u0026amp; Norvig (2003) group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability:\u0026#91;20\u0026#93;Simple reflex agents[edit]Simple reflex agentSimple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. The agent function is based on the condition-action rule: \"if condition, then action\".This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable. Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered.Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. If the agent can randomize its actions, it may be possible to escape from infinite loops.Model-based reflex agents[edit]Model-based reflex agentA model-based agent can handle partially observable environments. Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure that describes the part of the world which cannot be seen. This knowledge about \"how the world works\" is called a model of the world, hence the name \"model-based agent\".A model-based reflex agent should maintain some sort of internal model that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state. Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using the internal model. It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent.An agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment.\u0026#91;21\u0026#93;Goal-based agents[edit]Model-based, goal-based agentGoal-based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model-based agents, by using \"goal\" information. Goal information describes situations that are desirable. This provides the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state. Search and planning are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent's goals.Utility-based agents[edit]Model-based, utility-based agentGoal-based agents only distinguish between goal states and non-goal states. It is also possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is. This measure can be obtained through the use of a utility function which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state. A more general performance measure should allow a comparison of different world states according to how well they satisfied the agent's goals. The term utility can be used to describe how \"happy\" the agent is.A rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes - that is, what the agent expects to derive, on average, given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome. A utility-based agent has to model and keep track of its environment, tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception, representation, reasoning, and learning.Learning agents[edit]A general learning agentLearning has the advantage that it allows the agents to initially operate in unknown environments and to become more competent than its initial knowledge alone might allow. The most important distinction is between the \"learning element\", which is responsible for making improvements, and the \"performance element\", which is responsible for selecting external actions.The learning element uses feedback from the \"critic\" on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element, or \"actor\", should be modified to do better in the future.  The performance element is what we have previously considered to be the entire agent: it takes in percepts and decides on actions.The last component of the learning agent is the \"problem generator\". It is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences.Weiss's classification[edit]Weiss (2013) defines four classes of agents:Logic-based agents – in which the decision about what action to perform is made via logical deduction.Reactive agents – in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action.Belief-desire-intention agents – in which decision making depends upon the manipulation of data structures representing the beliefs, desires, and intentions of the agent; and finally,Layered architectures – in which decision making is realized via various software layers, each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction.Other[edit]In 2013, Alexander Wissner-Gross published a theory pertaining to Freedom and Intelligence for intelligent agents.\u0026#91;22\u0026#93;\u0026#91;23\u0026#93;Hierarchies of agents[edit]Main article: Multi-agent systemTo actively perform their functions, Intelligent Agents today are normally gathered in a hierarchical structure containing many “sub-agents”. Intelligent sub-agents process and perform lower-level functions. Taken together, the intelligent agent and sub-agents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence.Generally, an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators, and so that it operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator. However, a hierarchy of controller layers is often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low-level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex, high-level goals.\u0026#91;24\u0026#93;Agent function[edit]A simple agent program can be defined mathematically as a function f (called the \"agent function\")\u0026#91;25\u0026#93; which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient, feedback element, function or constant that affects eventual actions:                    f        :                  P                      \u0026#x2217;                          \u0026#x2192;        A              {\\displaystyle f:P^{\\ast }\\rightarrow A}  Agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of utility of individual options, deduction over logic rules, fuzzy logic, etc.\u0026#91;26\u0026#93;The program agent, instead, maps every possible percept to an action.\u0026#91;27\u0026#93;We use the term percept to refer to the agent's perceptional inputs at any given instant. In the following figures, an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.Applications[edit]This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

(September 2023)Hallerbach et al. discussed the application of agent-based approaches for the development and validation of automated driving systems via a digital twin of the vehicle-under-test and microscopic traffic simulation based on independent agents.\u0026#91;28\u0026#93; Waymo has created a multi-agent simulation environment Carcraft to test algorithms for self-driving cars.\u0026#91;29\u0026#93;\u0026#91;30\u0026#93; It simulates traffic interactions between human drivers, pedestrians and automated vehicles. People's behavior is imitated by artificial agents based on data of real human behavior. The basic idea of using agent-based modeling to understand self-driving cars was discussed as early as 2003.\u0026#91;31\u0026#93;Alternative definitions and uses[edit]\"Intelligent agent\" is also often used as a vague marketing term, sometimes synonymous with \"virtual personal assistant\".\u0026#91;32\u0026#93; Some 20th-century definitions characterize an agent as a program that aids a user or that acts on behalf of a user.\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; These examples are known as software agents, and sometimes an \"intelligent software agent\" (that is, a software agent with intelligence) is referred to as an \"intelligent agent\".According to Nikola Kasabov, IA systems should exhibit the following characteristics:\u0026#91;34\u0026#93;Accommodate new problem solving rules incrementallyAdapt online and in real timeAre able to analyze themselves in terms of behavior, error and success.Learn and improve through interaction with the environment (embodiment)Learn quickly from large amounts of dataHave memory-based exemplar storage and retrieval capacitiesHave parameters to represent short- and long-term memory, age, forgetting, etc.See also[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul{line-height:inherit;list-style:none;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol li,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul li{margin-bottom:0}Ambient intelligenceArtificial intelligence systems integrationAutonomous agentCognitive architecturesCognitive radio – a practical field for implementationCyberneticsDAYDREAMEREmbodied agentFederated search – the ability for agents to search heterogeneous data sources using a single vocabularyFriendly artificial intelligenceFuzzy agents – IA implemented with adaptive fuzzy logicGOAL agent programming languageHybrid intelligent systemIntelligent controlIntelligent systemJACK Intelligent AgentsMulti-agent system and multiple-agent system – multiple interactive agentsReinforcement learningSemantic Web – making data on the Web available for automated processing by agentsSocial simulationSoftware agentSoftware botNotes[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^ The Padgham \u0026amp;

program in a relationship of agency.The term agent is derived from the Latin agere (to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such \"action on behalf of\" implies the authority to decide which, if any, action is appropriate.\u0026#91;1\u0026#93;\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; Some agents are colloquially known as bots, from robot. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or as software such as a chatbot executing on a computer, such as a mobile device, e.g. Siri. Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people. Software agents interacting with people (e.g. chatbots, human-robot interaction environments) may possess human-like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech, personality or embody humanoid form (see Asimo).Related and derived concepts include intelligent agents (in particular exhibiting some aspects of artificial intelligence, such as reasoning), autonomous agents (capable of modifying the methods of achieving their objectives), distributed agents (being executed on physically distinct computers), multi-agent systems (distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone), and mobile agents (agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors).Concepts[edit]The basic attributes of an autonomous software agent are that agents:are not strictly invoked for a task, but activate themselves,may reside in wait status on a host, perceiving context,may get to run status on a host upon starting conditions,do not require interaction of user,may invoke other tasks including communication.Nwana's Category of Software AgentThe term \"agent\" describes a software abstraction, an idea, or a concept, similar to OOP terms such as methods, functions, and objects.\u0026#91;citation needed\u0026#93; The concept of an agent provides a convenient and powerful way to describe a complex software entity that is capable of acting with a certain degree of autonomy in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of its host. But unlike objects, which are defined in terms of methods and attributes, an agent is defined in terms of its behavior.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;Various authors have proposed different definitions of agents, these commonly include concepts such aspersistence (code is not executed on demand but runs continuously and decides for itself when it should perform some activity)autonomy (agents have capabilities of task selection, prioritization, goal-directed behavior, decision-making without human intervention)social ability (agents are able to engage other components through some sort of communication and coordination, they may collaborate on a task)reactivity (agents perceive the context in which they operate and react to it appropriately).Distinguishing agents from programs[edit]All agents are programs, but not all programs are agents. Contrasting the term with related concepts may help clarify its meaning. Franklin \u0026amp; Graesser (1997)\u0026#91;4\u0026#93; discuss four key notions that distinguish agents from arbitrary programs: reaction to the environment, autonomy, goal-orientation and persistence.Intuitive distinguishing agents from objects[edit]Agents are more autonomous than objects.Agents have flexible behavior: reactive, proactive, social.Agents have at least one thread of control but may have more.\u0026#91;5\u0026#93;Distinguishing agents from expert systems[edit]Expert systems are not coupled to their environment.Expert systems are not designed for reactive, proactive behavior.Expert systems do not consider social ability.\u0026#91;5\u0026#93;Distinguishing intelligent software agents from intelligent agents in AI[edit]Intelligent agents (also known as rational agents) are not just computer programs: they may also be machines, human beings, communities of human beings (such as firms) or anything that is capable of goal-directed behavior.(Russell \u0026amp; Norvig 2003) harv error: no target: CITEREFRussellNorvig2003 (help)Impact of software agents[edit]Software agents may offer various benefits to their end users by automating complex or repetitive tasks.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93; However, there are organizational and cultural impacts of this technology that need to be considered prior to implementing software agents.Organizational impact[edit]Work contentment and job satisfaction impact[edit]People like to perform easy tasks providing the sensation of success unless the repetition of the simple tasking is affecting the overall output. In general implementing software agents to perform administrative requirements provides a substantial increase in work contentment, as administering their own work does never please the worker. The effort freed up serves for a higher degree of engagement in the substantial tasks of individual work. Hence, software agents may provide the basics to implement self-controlled work, relieved from hierarchical controls and interference.\u0026#91;7\u0026#93; Such conditions may be secured by application of software agents for required formal support.Cultural impact[edit]The cultural effects of the implementation of software agents include trust affliction, skills erosion, privacy attrition and social detachment. Some users may not feel entirely comfortable fully delegating important tasks to software applications. Those who start relying solely on intelligent agents may lose important skills, for example, relating to information literacy. In order to act on a user's behalf, a software agent needs to have a complete understanding of a user's profile, including his/her personal preferences. This, in turn, may lead to unpredictable privacy issues. When users start relying on their software agents more, especially for communication activities, they may lose contact with other human users and look at the world with the eyes of their agents. These consequences are what agent researchers and users must consider when dealing with intelligent agent technologies.\u0026#91;8\u0026#93;History[edit]The concept of an agent can be traced back to Hewitt's Actor Model (Hewitt, 1977) - \"A self-contained, interactive and concurrently-executing object, possessing internal state and communication capability.\"\u0026#91;citation needed\u0026#93;To be more academic, software agent systems are a direct evolution of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS evolved from Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Parallel AI (PAI), thus inheriting all characteristics (good and bad) from DAI and AI.John Sculley's 1987 \"Knowledge Navigator\" video portrayed an image of a relationship between end-users and agents. Being an ideal first, this field experienced a series of unsuccessful top-down implementations, instead of a piece-by-piece, bottom-up approach. The range of agent types is now (from 1990) broad: WWW, search engines, etc.Examples  of intelligent software agents[edit].mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}See also: Intelligent agentBuyer agents (shopping bots)[edit]Buyer agents\u0026#91;9\u0026#93; travel around a network (e.g. the internet) retrieving information about goods and services. These agents, also known as 'shopping bots', work very efficiently for commodity products such as CDs, books, electronic components, and other one-size-fits-all products. Buyer agents are typically optimized to allow for digital payment services used in e-commerce and traditional businesses.\u0026#91;10\u0026#93;User agents (personal agents)[edit]User agents, or personal agents, are intelligent agents that take action on your behalf. In this category belong those intelligent agents that already perform, or will shortly perform, the following tasks:Check your e-mail, sort it according to the user's order of preference, and alert you when important emails arrive.Play computer games as your opponent or patrol game areas for you.Assemble customized news reports for you. There are several versions of these, including CNN.Find information for you on the subject of your choice.Fill out forms on the Web automatically for you, storing your information for future referenceScan Web pages looking for and highlighting text that constitutes the \"important\" part of the information thereDiscuss topics with you ranging from your deepest fears to sportsFacilitate with online job search duties by scanning known job boards and sending the resume to opportunities who meet the desired criteriaProfile synchronization across heterogeneous social networksMonitoring-and-surveillance (predictive) agents[edit]Monitoring and surveillance agents are used to observe and report on equipment, usually computer systems. The agents may keep track of company inventory levels, observe competitors' prices and relay them back to the company, watch stock manipulation by insider trading and rumors, etc.Service monitoringFor example, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has an agent that monitors inventory, planning, schedules equipment orders to keep costs down, and manages food storage facilities. These agents usually monitor complex computer networks that can keep track of the configuration of each computer connected to the network.A special case of Monitoring-and-Surveillance agents are organizations of agents used to emulate the Human Decision-Making process during tactical operations. The agents monitor the status of assets (ammunition, weapons available, platforms for transport, etc.) and receive Goals (Missions) from higher level agents. The Agents then pursue the Goals with the Assets at hand, minimizing expenditure of the Assets while maximizing Goal Attainment. (See Popplewell, \"Agents and Applicability\")Data-mining agents[edit]This agent uses information technology to find trends and patterns in an abundance of information from many different sources. The user can sort through this information in order to find whatever information they are seeking.A data mining agent operates in a data warehouse discovering information. A 'data warehouse' brings together information from many different sources. \"Data mining\" is the process of looking through the data warehouse to find information that you can use to take action, such as ways to increase sales or keep customers who are considering defecting.'Classification' is one of the most common types of data mining, which finds patterns in information and categorizes them into different classes. Data mining agents can also detect major shifts in trends or a key indicator and can detect the presence of new information and alert you to it. For example, the agent may detect a decline in the construction industry for an economy; based on this relayed information construction companies will be able to make intelligent decisions regarding the hiring/firing of employees or the purchase/lease of equipment in order to best suit their firm.Networking and communicating agents[edit]Some other examples of current intelligent agents include some spam filters, game bots, and server monitoring tools. Search engine indexing bots also qualify as intelligent agents.User agent - for browsing the World Wide WebMail transfer agent - For serving E-mail, such as Microsoft Outlook. Why? It communicates with the POP3 mail server, without users having to understand POP3 command protocols. It even has rule sets that filter mail for the user, thus sparing them the trouble of having to do it themselves.SNMP agentIn Unix-style networking servers, httpd is an HTTP daemon that implements the Hypertext Transfer Protocol at the root of the World Wide WebManagement agents used to manage telecom devicesCrowd simulation for safety planning or 3D computer graphics,Wireless beaconing agent is a simple process hosted single tasking entity for implementing wireless lock or electronic leash in conjunction with more complex software agents hosted e.g. on wireless receivers.Use of autonomous agents (deliberately equipped with noise) to optimize coordination in groups online.\u0026#91;11\u0026#93;Software development agents (aka software bots)[edit]Main article: Software botSoftware bots are becoming important in software engineering.\u0026#91;12\u0026#93;Security agents[edit]Agents are also used in software security application to intercept, examine and act on various types of content.  Example include: Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Agents\u0026#91;13\u0026#93; - examine user operations on a computer or network, compare with policies specifying allowed actions, and take appropriate action (e.g. allow, alert, block).  The more comprehensive DLP agents can also be used to perform EDR functions.Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Agents - monitor all activity on an endpoint computer in order to detect and respond to malicious activitiesCloud Access Security Broker (CASB) Agents - similar to DLP Agents, however examining traffic going to cloud applicationsDesign issues[edit]Issues to consider in the development of agent-based systems include how tasks are scheduled and how synchronization of tasks is achievedhow tasks are prioritized by agentshow agents can collaborate, or recruit resources,how agents can be re-instantiated in different environments, and how their internal state can be stored,how the environment will be probed and how a change of environment leads to behavioral changes of the agentshow messaging and communication can be achieved,what hierarchies of agents are useful (e.g. task execution agents, scheduling agents, resource providers ...).For software agents to work together efficiently they must share semantics of their data elements. This can be done by having computer systems publish their metadata.The definition of agent processing can be approached from two interrelated directions:internal state processing and ontologies for representing knowledgeinteraction protocols – standards for specifying communication of tasksAgent systems are used to model real-world systems with concurrency or parallel processing.Agent Machinery – Engines of various kinds, which support the varying degrees of intelligenceAgent Content – Data employed by the machinery in Reasoning and LearningAgent Access – Methods to enable the machinery to perceive content and perform actions as outcomes of ReasoningAgent Security – Concerns related to distributed computing, augmented by a few special concerns related to agentsThe agent uses its access methods to go out into local and remote databases to forage for content. These access methods may include setting up news stream delivery to the agent, or retrieval from bulletin boards, or using a spider to walk the Web. The content that is retrieved in this way is probably already partially filtered\u0026#160;– by the selection of the newsfeed or the databases that are searched. The agent next may use its detailed searching or language-processing machinery to extract keywords or signatures from the body of the content that has been received or retrieved. This abstracted content (or event) is then passed to the agent's Reasoning or inferencing machinery in order to decide what to do with the new content. This process combines the event content with the rule-based or knowledge content provided by the user. If this process finds a good hit or match in the new content, the agent may use another piece of its machinery to do a more detailed search on the content. Finally, the agent may decide to take an action based on the new content; for example, to notify the user that an important event has occurred. This action is verified by a security function and then given the authority of the user. The agent makes use of a user-access method to deliver that message to the user. If the user confirms that the event is important by acting quickly on the notification, the agent may also employ its learning machinery to increase its weighting for this kind of event.Bots can act on behalf of their creators to do good as well as bad. There are a few ways which bots can be created to demonstrate that they are designed with the best intention and are not built to do harm. This is first done by having a bot identify itself in the user-agent HTTP header when communicating with a site. The source IP address must also be validated to establish itself as legitimate. Next, the bot must also always respect a site's robots.txt file since it has become the standard across most of the web. And like respecting the robots.txt file, bots should shy away from being too aggressive and respect any crawl delay instructions.\u0026#91;14\u0026#93;Notions and frameworks for agents[edit]DAML (DARPA Agent Markup Language)3APL (Artificial Autonomous Agents Programming Language)GOAL agent programming languageOpen Agent Architecture (OAA)Web Ontology Language (OWL)daemons in Unix-like systems.Java Agent Template (JAT)Java Agent Development Framework (JADE)SARL agent programming language (arguably an Actor and not Agent oriented paradigm)See also[edit]Agent architectureChatbotData loss preventionEndpoint detection and responseSoftware botReferences[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Nwana, H.\u0026#160;S.

agents.\u0026#91;1\u0026#93;  It is sometimes referred to as software robotics (not to be confused with robot software).In traditional workflow automation tools, a software developer produces a list of actions to automate a task and interface to the back end system using internal application programming interfaces (APIs) or dedicated scripting language. In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to the use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems in that they allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving email containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a bookkeeping system.Historic evolution[edit]The typical benefits of robotic automation include reduced cost; increased speed, accuracy, and consistency; improved quality and scalability of production. Automation can also provide extra security, especially for sensitive data and financial services.As a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form of screen scraping, which can be traced back to early forms of malware\u0026#91;ambiguous\u0026#93;. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting of API integration into other enterprise applications, connectors into ITSM systems, terminal services and even some types of AI (e.g. Machine Learning) services such as image recognition.  It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature, resilient, scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; (who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation).A principal barrier to the adoption of self-service is often technological: it may not always be feasible or economically viable to retrofit new interfaces onto existing systems. Moreover, organisations may wish to layer a variable and configurable set of process rules on top of the system interfaces which may vary according to market offerings and the type of customer. This only adds to the cost and complexity of the technological implementation. Robotic automation software provides a pragmatic means of deploying new services in this situation, where the robots simply mimic the behaviour of humans to perform the back-end transcription or processing. The relative affordability of this approach arises from the fact that no new IT transformation or investment is required; instead the software robots simply leverage greater use out of existing IT assets.Use[edit]The hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in a virtual environment and not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of virtualization technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by the available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs. The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non-RPA solutions.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;There are however several risks with RPA. Criticism includes risks of stifling innovation and creating a more complex maintenance environment of existing software that now needs to consider the use of graphical user interfaces in a way they weren't intended to be used.\u0026#91;4\u0026#93;Impact on employment[edit].mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}See also: Technological unemployment and AutomationAccording to Harvard Business Review, most operations groups adopting RPA have promised their employees that automation would not result in layoffs.\u0026#91;5\u0026#93; Instead, workers have been redeployed to do more interesting work. One academic study highlighted that knowledge workers did not feel threatened by automation: they embraced it and viewed the robots as team-mates.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93; The same study highlighted that, rather than resulting in a lower \"headcount\", the technology was deployed in such a way as to achieve more work and greater productivity with the same number of people.Conversely, however, some analysts proffer that RPA represents a threat to the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.\u0026#91;7\u0026#93; The thesis behind this notion is that RPA will enable enterprises to \"repatriate\" processes from offshore locations into local data centers, with the benefit of this new technology. The effect, if true, will be to create high-value jobs for skilled process designers in onshore locations (and within the associated supply chain of IT hardware, data center management, etc.) but to decrease the available opportunity to low-skilled workers offshore. On the other hand, this discussion appears to be healthy ground for debate as another academic study was at pains to counter the so-called \"myth\" that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93;RPA actual use[edit]Banking and finance process automationMortgage and lending processesCustomer care automationeCommerce merchandising operationsSocial media marketingOptical character recognition applicationsData extraction processFixed automation process\u0026#91;clarification needed\u0026#93;Impact on society[edit]Academic studies\u0026#91;8\u0026#93;\u0026#91;9\u0026#93; project that RPA, among other technological trends, is expected to drive a new wave of productivity and efficiency gains in the global labour market. Although not directly attributable to RPA alone, Oxford University conjectures that up to 35% of all jobs might be automated by 2035.\u0026#91;8\u0026#93;There are geographic implications to the trend in robotic automation. In the example above where an offshored process is \"repatriated\" under the control of the client organization (or even displaced by a Business Process Outsourcer) from an offshore location to a data centre, the impact will be a deficit in economic activity to the offshore location and an economic benefit to the originating economy. On this basis, developed economies – with skills and technological infrastructure to develop and support a robotic automation capability – can be expected to achieve a net benefit from the trend.In a TEDx talk\u0026#91;10\u0026#93; hosted by University College London (UCL), entrepreneur David Moss explains that digital labour in the form of RPA is likely to revolutionize the cost model of the services industry by driving the price of products and services down, while simultaneously improving the quality of outcomes and creating increased opportunity for the personalization of services.In a separate TEDx in 2019 talk,\u0026#91;11\u0026#93; Japanese business executive, and former CIO of Barclays bank, Koichi Hasegawa noted that digital robots can be a positive effect on society if we start using a robot with empathy to help every person. He provides a case study of the Japanese insurance companies – Sompo Japan and Aioi – both of whom introduced bots to speed up the process of insurance pay-outs in past massive disaster incidents.Meanwhile, Professor Willcocks, author of the LSE paper\u0026#91;9\u0026#93; cited above, speaks of increased job satisfaction and intellectual stimulation, characterising the technology as having the ability to \"take the robot out of the human\",\u0026#91;12\u0026#93; a reference to the notion that robots will take over the mundane and repetitive portions of people's daily workload, leaving them to be used in more interpersonal roles or to concentrate on the remaining, more meaningful, portions of their day.It was also found in a 2021 study observing the effects of robotization in Europe that, the gender pay gap increased at a rate of .18% for every 1% increase in robotization of a given industry.\u0026#91;13\u0026#93;Unassisted RPA[edit]Unassisted RPA, or RPAAI,\u0026#91;14\u0026#93;\u0026#91;15\u0026#93; is the next generation of RPA related technologies. Technological advancements around artificial intelligence allow a process to be run on a computer without needing input from a user.Hyperautomation[edit]Hyperautomation is the application of advanced technologies like RPA, artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML) and process mining to augment workers and automate processes in ways that are significantly more impactful than traditional automation capabilities.\u0026#91;16\u0026#93;\u0026#91;17\u0026#93;\u0026#91;18\u0026#93; Hyperautomation is the combination of automation tools to deliver work.\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;Gartner’s report notes that this trend was kicked off with robotic process automation (RPA). The report notes that, \"RPA alone is not hyperautomation. Hyperautomation requires a combination of tools to help support replicating pieces of where the human is involved in a task.\"\u0026#91;20\u0026#93;Outsourcing[edit]Back office clerical processes outsourced by large organisations - particularly those sent offshore - tend to be simple and transactional in nature, requiring little (if any) analysis or subjective judgement. This would seem to make an ideal starting point for organizations beginning to adopt robotic automation for the back office. Whether client organisations choose to take outsourced processes back \"in house\" from their Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) providers, thus representing a threat to the future of the BPO business,\u0026#91;21\u0026#93; or whether the BPOs implement such automations on their clients' behalf may well depend on a number of factors.Conversely however, a BPO provider may seek to effect some form of client lock-in by means of automation. By removing cost from a business operation, where the BPO provider is considered to be the owner of the intellectual property and physical implementation of a robotic automation solution (perhaps in terms of hardware, ownership of software licences, etc.), the provider can make it very difficult for the client to take a process back \"in house\" or elect a new BPO provider. This effect occurs as the associated cost savings made through automation would - temporarily at least - have to be reintroduced to the business whilst the technical solution is reimplemented in the new operational context.The geographically agnostic nature of software means that new business opportunities may arise for those organisations that have a political or regulatory impediment to offshoring or outsourcing. A robotised automation can be hosted in a data centre in any jurisdiction and this has two major consequences for BPO providers. Firstly, for example, a sovereign government may not be willing or legally able to outsource the processing of tax affairs and security administration.  On this basis, if robots are compared to a human workforce, this creates a genuinely new opportunity for a \"third sourcing\" option, after the choices of onshore vs. offshore. Secondly, and conversely, BPO providers have previously relocated outsourced operations to different political and geographic territories in response to changing wage inflation and new labor arbitrage opportunities elsewhere. By contrast, a data centre solution would seem to offer a fixed and predictable cost base that, if sufficiently low in cost on a robot vs. human basis,  would seem to eliminate any potential need or desire to continually relocate operational bases.Examples[edit]Voice recognition and digital dictation software linked to join up business processes for straight through processing without manual interventionSpecialised Remote Infrastructure Management software featuring automated investigation and resolution of problems, using robots for the first line IT supportChatbots used by internet retailers and service providers to service customer requests for information.

interface that aims to mimic human conversation through text or voice interactions.\u0026#91;2\u0026#93;\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;\u0026#91;4\u0026#93; Modern chatbots are typically online and use artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language and simulating the way a human would behave as a conversational partner. Such technologies often utilize aspects of deep learning and natural language processing, but more simplistic chatbots have been around for decades prior.Recently, this field has gained widespread attention due to the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT (using GPT-3 or GPT-4),\u0026#91;5\u0026#93; released in 2022, followed by alternatives such as Microsoft's Bing Chat (which uses OpenAI's GPT-4) and Google's Bard.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93; Such examples reflect the recent practice of such products being built based upon broad foundational large language models that get fine-tuned so as to target specific tasks or applications (i.e. simulating human conversation, in the case of chatbots). Chatbots can also be designed or customized to further target even more specific situations and/or particular subject-matter domains.\u0026#91;7\u0026#93;A major area where chatbots have long been used is in customer service and support, such as with various sorts of virtual assistants.\u0026#91;8\u0026#93; Companies spanning various industries have begun using the latest generative artificial intelligence technologies to power more advanced developments in such areas.\u0026#91;7\u0026#93;BackgroundIn 1950, Alan Turing's famous article \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" was published,\u0026#91;9\u0026#93; which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:In artificial intelligence, machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained, its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures. The observer says to himself \"I could have written that\". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios. The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". Few programs ever needed it more.\u0026#91;10\u0026#93;ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of the corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').\u0026#91;10\u0026#93; Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as \"intelligent\".Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\".DevelopmentAmong the most notable early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).\u0026#91;11\u0026#93;\u0026#91;12\u0026#93;\u0026#91;13\u0026#93;\u0026#91;14\u0026#93; More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).\u0026#91;15\u0026#93;From 1978\u0026#91;16\u0026#93; to some time after 1983,\u0026#91;17\u0026#93; the CYRUS project led by Janet Kolodner constructed a chatbot simulating Cyrus Vance (57th United States Secretary of State). It used case-based reasoning, and updated its database daily by parsing wire news from United Press International. The program was unable to process the news items subsequent to the surprise resignation of Cyrus Vance in April 1980, and the team constructed another chatbot simulating his successor, Edmund Muskie.\u0026#91;18\u0026#93;\u0026#91;17\u0026#93;One pertinent field of AI research is natural-language processing. Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML,\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called, Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimize their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;Chatbots may use neural networks as a language model. For example, generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), which use the transformer architecture, have become common to build sophisticated chatbots. The \"pre-training\" in its name refers to the initial training process on a large text corpus, which provides a solid foundation for the model to perform well on downstream tasks with limited amounts of task-specific data. An example of a GPT chatbot is ChatGPT.\u0026#91;20\u0026#93; Despite criticism of its accuracy, ChatGPT has gained attention for its detailed responses and historical knowledge. Another example is BioGPT, developed by Microsoft, which focuses on answering biomedical questions.\u0026#91;21\u0026#93;\u0026#91;22\u0026#93;DBpedia created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017.\u0026#91;23\u0026#93;\u0026#91;24\u0026#93;\u0026#91;25\u0026#93; It can communicate through Facebook Messenger.ApplicationSee also: Virtual assistantMessaging appsMany companies' chatbots run on messaging apps or simply via SMS. They are used for B2C customer service, sales and marketing.\u0026#91;26\u0026#93;In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform. There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.\u0026#91;27\u0026#93;Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp. Airlines KLM and Aeroméxico both announced their participation in the testing;\u0026#91;28\u0026#93;\u0026#91;29\u0026#93;\u0026#91;30\u0026#93;\u0026#91;31\u0026#93; both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.The bots usually appear as one of the user's contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat.Many banks, insurers, media companies, e-commerce companies, airlines, hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement,\u0026#91;32\u0026#93; for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them.\u0026#91;33\u0026#93;A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.\u0026#91;34\u0026#93; According to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.\u0026#91;35\u0026#93;As part of company apps and websitesPrevious generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. Ask Jenn from Alaska Airlines which debuted in 2008\u0026#91;36\u0026#93; or Expedia's virtual customer service agent which launched in 2011.\u0026#91;36\u0026#93;\u0026#91;37\u0026#93; The newer generation of chatbots includes IBM Watson-powered \"Rocky\", introduced in February 2017 by the New York City-based e-commerce company Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers.\u0026#91;38\u0026#93;\u0026#91;39\u0026#93;Chatbot sequencesUsed by marketers to script sequences of messages, very similar to an autoresponder sequence. Such sequences can be triggered by user opt-in or the use of keywords within user interactions. After a trigger occurs a sequence of messages is delivered until the next anticipated user response. Each user response is used in the decision tree to help the chatbot navigate the response sequences to deliver the correct response message.Company internal platformsOther companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even in Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects. Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simple yet time-consuming processes when requesting sick leave.\u0026#91;40\u0026#93; Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Renault and Citroën are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact. A SaaS chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the F8 Conference when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg unveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app.\u0026#91;41\u0026#93; In large companies, like in hospitals and aviation organizations, IT architects are designing reference architectures for Intelligent Chatbots that are used to unlock and share knowledge and experience in the organization more efficiently, and reduce the errors in answers from expert service desks significantly.\u0026#91;42\u0026#93; These Intelligent Chatbots make use of all kinds of artificial intelligence like image moderation and natural-language understanding (NLU), natural-language generation (NLG), machine learning and deep learning.Customer serviceMany high-tech banking organizations are looking to integrate automated AI-based solutions such as chatbots into their customer service in order to provide faster and cheaper assistance to their clients who are becoming increasingly comfortable with technology.  In particular, chatbots can efficiently conduct a dialogue, usually replacing other communication tools such as email, phone, or SMS. In banking, their major application is related to quick customer service answering common requests, as well as transactional support.Several studies report significant reduction in the cost of customer services, expected to lead to billions of dollars of economic savings in the next ten years.\u0026#91;43\u0026#93; In 2019, Gartner predicted that by 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions globally will be handled completely by AI.\u0026#91;44\u0026#93;  A study by Juniper Research in 2019 estimates retail sales resulting from chatbot-based interactions will reach $112 billion by 2023.\u0026#91;45\u0026#93;Since 2016, when Facebook allowed businesses to deliver automated customer support, e-commerce guidance, content, and interactive experiences through chatbots, a large variety of chatbots were developed for the Facebook Messenger platform.\u0026#91;46\u0026#93;In 2016, Russia-based Tochka Bank launched the world's first Facebook bot for a range of financial services, including a possibility of making payments.\u0026#91;47\u0026#93;In July 2016, Barclays Africa also launched a Facebook chatbot, making it the first bank to do so in Africa.\u0026#91;48\u0026#93;The France's third-largest bank by total assets\u0026#91;49\u0026#93; Société Générale launched their chatbot called SoBot in March 2018. While 80% of users of the SoBot expressed their satisfaction after having tested it, Société Générale deputy director Bertrand Cozzarolo stated that it will never replace the expertise provided by a human advisor.\u0026#91;50\u0026#93;The advantages of using chatbots for customer interactions in banking include cost reduction, financial advice, and 24/7 support.\u0026#91;51\u0026#93;\u0026#91;52\u0026#93;HealthcareSee also: Artificial intelligence in healthcareChatbots are also appearing in the healthcare industry.\u0026#91;53\u0026#93;\u0026#91;54\u0026#93; A study suggested that physicians in the United States believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments, locating health clinics, or providing medication information.\u0026#91;55\u0026#93;Whatsapp has teamed up with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to make a chatbot service that answers users' questions on COVID-19.\u0026#91;56\u0026#93;In 2020, The Indian Government launched a chatbot called MyGov Corona Helpdesk,\u0026#91;57\u0026#93; that worked through Whatsapp and helped people access information about the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\u0026#91;58\u0026#93;\u0026#91;59\u0026#93;Certain patient groups are still reluctant to use chatbots. A mixed-methods study showed that people are still hesitant to use chatbots for their healthcare due to poor understanding of the technological complexity, the lack of empathy, and concerns about cyber-security.\u0026#91;60\u0026#93; The analysis showed that while 6% had heard of a health chatbot and 3% had experience of using it, 67% perceived themselves as likely to use one within 12 months. The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information (78%), booking a medical appointment (78%), and looking for local health services (80%). However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health. The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%). While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea. Interestingly, 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot. Therefore, perceived trustworthiness, individual attitudes towards bots, and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots.PoliticsSee also: Government by algorithm §\u0026#160;AI politiciansIn New Zealand, the chatbot SAM – short for Semantic Analysis Machine\u0026#91;61\u0026#93; (made by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech\u0026#91;62\u0026#93;) – has been developed. It is designed to share its political thoughts, for example on topics such as climate change, healthcare and education, etc. It talks to people through Facebook Messenger.\u0026#91;63\u0026#93;\u0026#91;64\u0026#93;\u0026#91;65\u0026#93;\u0026#91;66\u0026#93;In 2022, the chatbot \"Leader Lars\" or \"Leder Lars\" was nominated for The Synthetic Party to run in the Danish parliamentary election,\u0026#91;67\u0026#93; and was built by the artist collective Computer Lars.\u0026#91;68\u0026#93; Leader Lars differed from earlier virtual politicians by leading a political party and by not pretending to be an objective candidate.\u0026#91;69\u0026#93; This chatbot engaged in critical discussions on politics with users from around the world.\u0026#91;70\u0026#93;In India, the state government has launched a chatbot for its Aaple Sarkar platform,\u0026#91;71\u0026#93; which provides conversational access to information regarding public services managed.\u0026#91;72\u0026#93;\u0026#91;73\u0026#93;ToysChatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing, such as toys.\u0026#91;74\u0026#93;Hello Barbie is an Internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk,\u0026#91;75\u0026#93; which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.\u0026#91;76\u0026#93; These characters' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.\u0026#91;77\u0026#93;The My Friend Cayla doll was marketed as a line of 18-inch (46\u0026#160;cm) dolls which uses speech recognition technology in conjunction with an Android or iOS mobile app to recognize the child's speech and have a conversation. It, like the Hello Barbie doll, attracted controversy due to vulnerabilities with the doll's Bluetooth stack and its use of data collected from the child's speech.IBM's Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as CogniToys\u0026#91;74\u0026#93; intended to interact with children for educational purposes.\u0026#91;78\u0026#93;Malicious useMalicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. They were commonly found on Yahoo! Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messaging protocols. There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service's website.\u0026#91;79\u0026#93;Tay, an AI chatbot that learns from previous interaction, caused major controversy due to it being targeted by internet trolls on Twitter. The bot was exploited, and after 16 hours began to send extremely offensive Tweets to users. This suggests that although the bot learned effectively from experience, adequate protection was not put in place to prevent misuse.\u0026#91;80\u0026#93;If a text-sending algorithm can pass itself off as a human instead of a chatbot, its message would be more credible. Therefore, human-seeming chatbots with well-crafted online identities could start scattering fake news that seems plausible, for instance making false claims during an election. With enough chatbots, it might be even possible to achieve artificial social proof.\u0026#91;81\u0026#93;\u0026#91;82\u0026#93;Limitations of chatbotsThe creation and implementation of chatbots is still a developing area, heavily related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, so the provided solutions, while possessing obvious advantages, have some important limitations in terms of functionalities and use cases. However, this is changing over time.The most common limitations are listed below:\u0026#91;83\u0026#93;As the input/output database is fixed and limited, chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query.\u0026#91;52\u0026#93;A chatbot's efficiency highly depends on language processing and is limited because of irregularities, such as accents and mistakes.Chatbots are unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation opportunities are limited.\u0026#91;83\u0026#93;Chatbots require a large amount of conversational data to train.  Generative models, which are based on deep learning algorithms to  generate new responses word by word based on user input, are usually trained on a large dataset of natural-language phrases.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;Chatbots have difficulty managing non-linear conversations that must go back and forth on a topic with a user.\u0026#91;84\u0026#93;As it happens usually with technology-led changes in existing services, some consumers, more often than not from older generations, are uncomfortable with chatbots due to their limited understanding, making it obvious that their requests are being dealt with by machines.\u0026#91;83\u0026#93;Chatbots and jobsChatbots are increasingly present in businesses and often are used to automate tasks that do not require skill-based talents. With customer service taking place via messaging apps as well as phone calls, there are growing numbers of use-cases where chatbot deployment gives organizations a clear return on investment. Call center workers may be particularly at risk from AI-driven chatbots.\u0026#91;85\u0026#93;Chatbot jobsChatbot developers create, debug, and maintain applications that automate customer services or other communication processes. Their duties include reviewing and simplifying code when needed. They may also help companies implement bots in their operations.A study by Forrester (June 2017) predicted that 25% of all jobs would be impacted by AI technologies by 2019.\u0026#91;86\u0026#93;See also.mw-parser-output .portalbox{padding:0;margin:0.5em 0;display:table;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:175px;list-style:none}.mw-parser-output .portalborder{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0.1em;background:#f9f9f9}.mw-parser-output .portalbox-entry{display:table-row;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;height:1.9em;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portalbox-image{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portalbox-link{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .portalleft{clear:left;float:left;margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portalright{clear:right;float:right;margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}}Linguistics portal.mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul{line-height:inherit;list-style:none;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol li,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul li{margin-bottom:0}Applications of artificial intelligenceAutonomous agentChatGPT (from OpenAI)Conversational user interfaceDead Internet theoryEugene GoostmanFriendly artificial intelligenceHybrid intelligent systemIntelligent agentInternet botList of chatbotsMulti-agent systemNatural language processingSocial botSoftware agentSoftware botStochastic parrotTwitterbotReferences.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Mauldin, Michael (1994), \"ChatterBots, TinyMuds, and the Turing Test: Entering the Loebner Prize Competition\", Proceedings of the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI Press, archived from the original on 13 December 2007, retrieved 5 March 2008^ \"What is a chatbot?\". techtarget.com.

And for teaching professionals, the technology provided by AI can improve the quality of the educational process and teaching skills.\u0026#91;67\u0026#93;AI text detectors can be used to scan essays generated by artificial intelligence in order to try to establish genuine authorship. However, a study found that seven of the most used of these detectors often wrongly flagged articles written by those whose first language was not English as AI-generated, thus discriminating against so called 'non-native' English speakers.\u0026#91;68\u0026#93;Finance[edit]‹\u0026#160;The template below (Split section) is being considered for merging. See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus.\u0026#160;›It has been suggested that this section be split out  into another article\u0026#32;titled Artificial intelligence in finance. (Discuss) (April 2022)Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking began in 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank launched a fraud prevention taskforce to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.\u0026#91;69\u0026#93; Kasisto and Moneystream use AI.Banks use AI to organize operations, for bookkeeping, investing in stocks, and managing properties. AI can react to changes when business is not taking place.\u0026#91;70\u0026#93; AI is used to combat fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns for any abnormal changes or anomalies.\u0026#91;71\u0026#93;\u0026#91;72\u0026#93;\u0026#91;73\u0026#93;The use of AI in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories.\u0026#91;74\u0026#93; For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus enable individualized pricing. AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus make markets more efficient.\u0026#91;75\u0026#93; The application of artificial intelligence in the financial industry can alleviate the financing constraints of non-state-owned enterprises. Especially for smaller and more innovative enterprises.\u0026#91;76\u0026#93;Trading and investment[edit]Algorithmic trading involves the use of AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds orders of magnitude greater than any human is capable of, making millions of trades in a day without human intervention. Such high-frequency trading represents a fast-growing sector. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios that are AI-managed. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional investors but include smaller firms trading with their own AI systems.\u0026#91;77\u0026#93;Large financial institutions use AI to assist with their investment practices. BlackRock's AI engine, Aladdin, is used both within the company and by clients to help with investment decisions. Its functions include the use of natural language processing to analyze text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use SQREEM (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) to mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with wealth management products.\u0026#91;78\u0026#93;Underwriting[edit]Online lender Upstart uses machine learning for underwriting.\u0026#91;79\u0026#93;ZestFinance's Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform is used for credit underwriting. This platform uses machine learning to analyze data including purchase transactions and how a customer fills out a form to score borrowers. The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit histories.\u0026#91;80\u0026#93;Audit[edit]AI makes continuous auditing possible. Potential benefits include reducing audit risk, increasing the level of assurance, and reducing audit duration.\u0026#91;81\u0026#93;\u0026#91;quantify\u0026#93;Anti-money laundering[edit]AI software, such as LaundroGraph which uses contemporary suboptimal datasets, could be used for anti-money laundering (AML).\u0026#91;82\u0026#93;\u0026#91;83\u0026#93; AI can be used to \"develop the AML pipeline into a robust, scalable solution with a reduced false positive rate and high adaptability\".\u0026#91;84\u0026#93; A study about deep learning for AML identified \"key challenges for researchers\" to have \"access to recent real transaction data and scarcity of labelled training data; and data being highly imbalanced\" and suggests future research should bring-out \"explainability, graph deep learning using natural language processing (NLP), unsupervised and reinforcement learning to handle lack of labelled data; and joint research programs between the research community and industry to benefit from domain knowledge and controlled access to data\".\u0026#91;85\u0026#93;History[edit]In the 1980s, AI started to become prominent in finance as expert systems were commercialized. For example, Dupont created 100 expert systems, which helped them to save almost $10 million per year.\u0026#91;86\u0026#93; One of the first systems was the Protrader expert system that predicted the 87-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1986. \"The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism.\"\u0026#91;87\u0026#93;One of the first expert systems to help with financial plans was PlanPowerm and Client Profiling System, created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX). It was launched in 1986. It helped create personal financial plans for people.\u0026#91;88\u0026#93;In the 1990s AI was applied to fraud detection.

(November 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Air Operations Division (AOD) uses AI for expert systems. AIs operate as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.\u0026#91;362\u0026#93;Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated.AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can fly independently or in swarms.\u0026#91;363\u0026#93;AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS, which is a rule-based expert system using information from TF-30 documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the F-111C. The system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers.Speech recognition allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to drones.Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,\u0026#91;364\u0026#93; or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule-based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective.NASA[edit]In 2003 a Dryden Flight Research Center project created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing can be achieved.\u0026#91;365\u0026#93; The software compensated for damaged components by relying on the remaining undamaged components.\u0026#91;366\u0026#93;The 2016 Intelligent Autopilot System combined apprenticeship learning and behavioral cloning whereby the autopilot observed low-level actions required to maneuver the airplane and high-level strategy used to apply those actions.\u0026#91;367\u0026#93;Maritime[edit]Neural networks are used by situational awareness systems in ships and boats.\u0026#91;368\u0026#93; There also are autonomous boats.Environmental monitoring[edit]See also: Climate-smart agricultureAutonomous ships that monitor the ocean, AI-driven satellite data analysis, passive acoustics\u0026#91;369\u0026#93; or remote sensing and other applications of environmental monitoring make use of machine learning.\u0026#91;370\u0026#93;\u0026#91;371\u0026#93;\u0026#91;372\u0026#93;\u0026#91;188\u0026#93;For example, \"Global Plastic Watch\" is an AI-based satellite monitoring-platform for analysis/tracking of plastic waste sites to help prevention of plastic pollution – primarily ocean pollution – by helping identify who and where mismanages plastic waste, dumping it into oceans.\u0026#91;373\u0026#93;\u0026#91;374\u0026#93;Early-warning systems[edit]Machine learning can be used to spot early-warning signs of disasters and environmental issues, possibly including natural pandemics,\u0026#91;375\u0026#93;\u0026#91;376\u0026#93; earthquakes,\u0026#91;377\u0026#93;\u0026#91;378\u0026#93;\u0026#91;379\u0026#93; landslides,\u0026#91;380\u0026#93; heavy rainfall,\u0026#91;381\u0026#93; long-term water supply vulnerability,\u0026#91;382\u0026#93; tipping-points of ecosystem collapse,\u0026#91;383\u0026#93; cyanobacterial bloom outbreaks,\u0026#91;384\u0026#93; and droughts.\u0026#91;385\u0026#93;\u0026#91;386\u0026#93;\u0026#91;387\u0026#93;Computer science[edit]‹\u0026#160;The template below (Split section) is being considered for merging.

For other meanings, see Mechanoid (disambiguation).\"Androids\" redirects here. For other uses, see Androids (disambiguation).An android is a humanoid robot\u0026#91;1\u0026#93; or other artificial being\u0026#91;2\u0026#93;\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;\u0026#91;4\u0026#93; often made from a flesh-like material.\u0026#91;2\u0026#93; Historically, androids were completely within the domain of science fiction and frequently seen in film and television, but advances in robot technology now allow the design of functional and realistic\u0026#91;5\u0026#93; humanoid robots.\u0026#91;6\u0026#93;Terminology[edit]Early example of the term androides used to describe human-like mechanical devices, London Times, 22 December 1795The Oxford English Dictionary traces the earliest use (as \"Androides\") to Ephraim Chambers' 1728 Cyclopaedia, in reference to an automaton that St. Albertus Magnus allegedly created.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;\u0026#91;7\u0026#93; By the late 1700s, \"androides\", elaborate mechanical devices resembling humans performing human activities, were displayed in exhibit halls.\u0026#91;8\u0026#93;The term \"android\" appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons.\u0026#91;9\u0026#93; The term android was used in a more modern sense by the French author Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam in his work Tomorrow's Eve (1886).\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, \"In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.\" The term made an impact into English pulp science fiction starting from Jack Williamson's The Cometeers (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by Edmond Hamilton's Captain Future stories (1940–1944).\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;Although Karel Čapek's robots in R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (1921)—the play that introduced the word robot to the world—were organic artificial humans, the word \"robot\" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; The term \"android\" can mean either one of these,\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; while a cyborg (\"cybernetic organism\" or \"bionic man\") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.The term \"droid\", popularized by George Lucas in the original Star Wars film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of \"android\", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like R2-D2. The word \"android\" was used in Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" The abbreviation \"andy\", coined as a pejorative by writer Philip K. Dick in his novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series Total Recall 2070.\u0026#91;10\u0026#93;While the term \"android\" is used in reference to human-looking robots in general (not necessarily male-looking humanoid robots), a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a gynoid. Besides one can refer to robots without alluding to their sexual appearance by calling them anthrobots (a portmanteau of anthrōpos and robot; see anthrobotics) or anthropoids (short for anthropoid robots; the term humanoids is not appropriate because it is already commonly used to refer to human-like organic species in the context of science fiction, futurism and speculative astrobiology).\u0026#91;11\u0026#93;Authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg. In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only superficial, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; In other stories, authors have used the word \"android\" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93; Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;Eric G. Wilson, who defines an android as a \"synthetic human being\", distinguishes between three types of android, based on their body's composition:the mummy type – made of \"dead things\" or \"stiff, inanimate, natural material\", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statuesthe golem type – made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculithe automaton type – made from a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots\u0026#91;4\u0026#93;Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: simulacra (devices that exhibit likeness) and automata (devices that have independence).Projects[edit]Several projects aiming to create androids that look, and, to a certain degree, speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway.Japan[edit].mw-parser-output .ambox{border:1px solid #a2a9b1;border-left:10px solid #36c;background-color:#fbfbfb;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+link+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+style+.ambox,.mw-parser-output .ambox+.mw-empty-elt+link+link+.ambox{margin-top:-1px}html body.mediawiki .mw-parser-output .ambox.mbox-small-left{margin:4px 1em 4px 0;overflow:hidden;width:238px;border-collapse:collapse;font-size:88%;line-height:1.25em}.mw-parser-output .ambox-speedy{border-left:10px solid #b32424;background-color:#fee7e6}.mw-parser-output .ambox-delete{border-left:10px solid #b32424}.mw-parser-output .ambox-content{border-left:10px solid #f28500}.mw-parser-output .ambox-style{border-left:10px solid #fc3}.mw-parser-output .ambox-move{border-left:10px solid #9932cc}.mw-parser-output .ambox-protection{border-left:10px solid #a2a9b1}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-text{border:none;padding:0.25em 0.5em;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image{border:none;padding:2px 0 2px 0.5em;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-imageright{border:none;padding:2px 0.5em 2px 0;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-empty-cell{border:none;padding:0;width:1px}.mw-parser-output .ambox .mbox-image-div{width:52px}html.client-js body.skin-minerva .mw-parser-output .mbox-text-span{margin-left:23px!important}@media(min-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .ambox{margin:0 10%}}This section needs expansion\u0026#32;with: more recent examples and additional citations.

(October 2018)DER 01, a Japanese actroidJapanese robotics have been leading the field since the 1970s.\u0026#91;12\u0026#93; Waseda University initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot.\u0026#91;13\u0026#93;\u0026#91;14\u0026#93; Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.\u0026#91;14\u0026#93;\u0026#91;15\u0026#93;\u0026#91;16\u0026#93;In 1984, WABOT-2 was revealed, and made a number of improvements. It was capable of playing the organ. Wabot-2 had ten fingers and two feet, and was able to read a score of music. It was also able to accompany a person.\u0026#91;17\u0026#93; In 1986, Honda began its humanoid research and development program, to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans.\u0026#91;18\u0026#93;The Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Ishiguro at Osaka University, and the Kokoro company demonstrated the Actroid at Expo 2005 in Aichi Prefecture, Japan and released the Telenoid R1 in 2010. In 2006, Kokoro developed a new DER 2 android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165\u0026#160;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The \"air servosystem\" which Kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the Tokyo University of Science, has developed an android head called Saya, which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in Yokohama, Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is working at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.The Waseda University (Japan) and NTT docomo's manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot WD-2. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three degrees of freedom. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To \"copy\" a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.Singapore[edit]Prof Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine. Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly.Assoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical \u0026amp; Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R\u0026amp;D development in tele-presence robotics, creating EDGAR. A remote user can control EDGAR with the user's face and expressions displayed on the robot's face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements.\u0026#91;19\u0026#93;South Korea[edit]EveR-2, the first android that can singKITECH researched and developed EveR-1, an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial \"musculature\" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words. She is 160 cm tall and weighs 50 kg, matching the average figure of a Korean woman in her twenties. EveR-1's name derives from the Biblical Eve, plus the letter r for robot. EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables speech recognition and vocal synthesis, at the same time processing lip synchronization and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-CCD cameras with face recognition technology. An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression. Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing. In South Korea, the Ministry of Information and Communication had an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020.\u0026#91;20\u0026#93; Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2016 at a cost of 500 billion won (US$440 million), of which 50 billion is direct government investment.\u0026#91;21\u0026#93; The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.\u0026#91;22\u0026#93;United States[edit]Walt Disney and a staff of Imagineers created Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln that debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair.\u0026#91;23\u0026#93;Dr. William Barry, an Education Futurist and former visiting West Point Professor of Philosophy and Ethical Reasoning at the United States Military Academy, created an AI android character named \"Maria Bot\". This Interface AI android was named after the infamous fictional robot Maria in the 1927 film Metropolis, as a well-behaved distant relative. Maria Bot is the first AI Android Teaching Assistant at the university level.\u0026#91;24\u0026#93;\u0026#91;25\u0026#93; Maria Bot has appeared as a keynote speaker as a duo with Barry for a TEDx talk in Everett, Washington in February 2020.\u0026#91;26\u0026#93;Resembling a human from the shoulders up, Maria Bot is a virtual being android that has complex facial expressions and head movement and engages in conversation about a variety of subjects. She uses AI to process and synthesize information to make her own decisions on how to talk and engage. She collects data through conversations, direct data inputs such as books or articles, and through internet sources.Maria Bot was built by an international high-tech company for Barry to help improve education quality and eliminate education poverty. Maria Bot is designed to create new ways for students to engage and discuss ethical issues raised by the increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence. Barry also uses Maria Bot to demonstrate that programming a robot with life-affirming, ethical framework makes them more likely to help humans to do the same.\u0026#91;27\u0026#93;Maria Bot is an ambassador robot for good and ethical AI technology.\u0026#91;28\u0026#93;Hanson Robotics, Inc., of Texas and KAIST produced an android portrait of Albert Einstein, using Hanson's facial android technology mounted on KAIST's life-size walking bipedal robot body. This Einstein android, also called \"Albert Hubo\", thus represents the first full-body walking android in history.\u0026#91;29\u0026#93; Hanson Robotics, the FedEx Institute of Technology,\u0026#91;30\u0026#93; and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of sci-fi author Philip K. Dick (creator of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the basis for the film Blade Runner), with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author's works.\u0026#91;31\u0026#93; In 2005, the PKD android won a first-place artificial intelligence award from AAAI.Use in fiction[edit]See also: List of fictional robots and androidsAndroids are a staple of science fiction. Isaac Asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence, notably in his 1950s series I, Robot.\u0026#91;32\u0026#93; One thing common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots—such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved.\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.\u0026#91;3\u0026#93;\u0026#91;33\u0026#93;The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance—or even human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions.\u0026#91;4\u0026#93;\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; Some android heroes seek, like Pinocchio, to become human, as in the film Bicentennial Man,\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; or Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Others, as in the film Westworld, rebel against abuse by careless humans.\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; Android hunter Deckard in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and its film adaptation Blade Runner discovers that his targets appear to be, in some ways, more \"human\" than he is.\u0026#91;33\u0026#93; Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories \"about\" androids; they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human.\u0026#91;33\u0026#93;One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society, as in Blade Runner.\u0026#91;34\u0026#93; Perhaps the clearest example of this is John Brunner's 1968 novel Into the Slave Nebula, where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human.\u0026#91;35\u0026#93; More recently, the androids Bishop and Annalee Call in the films Aliens and Alien Resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an \"Other\".\u0026#91;36\u0026#93; The 2018 video game Detroit: Become Human also explores how androids are treated as second class citizens in a near future society.Female androids, or \"gynoids\", are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical \"perfect woman\".\u0026#91;37\u0026#93; Examples include the Greek myth of Pygmalion and the female robot Maria in Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Some gynoids, like Pris in Blade Runner, are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of \"pleasing men's violent sexual desires\",\u0026#91;38\u0026#93; or as submissive, servile companions, such as in The Stepford Wives. Fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing \"essentialist ideas of femininity\",\u0026#91;39\u0026#93; although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and misogyny in society.\u0026#91;40\u0026#93;The 2015 Japanese film Sayonara, starring Geminoid F, was promoted as \"the first movie to feature an android performing opposite a human actor\".\u0026#91;41\u0026#93;See also[edit].mw-parser-output .div-col{margin-top:0.3em;column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .div-col-small{font-size:90%}.mw-parser-output .div-col-rules{column-rule:1px solid #aaa}.mw-parser-output .div-col dl,.mw-parser-output .div-col ol,.mw-parser-output .div-col ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .div-col li,.mw-parser-output .div-col dd{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul{line-height:inherit;list-style:none;margin:0}.mw-parser-output .plainlist ol li,.mw-parser-output .plainlist ul li{margin-bottom:0}ActroidAndroid scienceAnimatronicAudio-AnimatronicsAutomatonCyborgDomestic robotGynoidHumanoid robotNeuroroboticsReplicantSynthoidUncanny valleyReferences[edit].mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}^ .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Van Riper, A.
